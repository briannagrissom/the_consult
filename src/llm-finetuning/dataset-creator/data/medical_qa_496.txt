    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 technology facilitate precise genome editing in eukaryotic cells?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 employs a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a specific DNA sequence, directing the Cas9 endonuclease to that location. Cas9 induces a double-strand break (DSB) at the target site. The cell repairs the DSB via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), often introducing insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt the gene, or homology-directed repair (HDR) using a provided DNA template, allowing precise gene editing. The gRNA design and delivery method influence efficiency and off-target effects, which require careful validation. Modifications to Cas9, such as catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to transcriptional activators or repressors, enable epigenetic modulation of gene expression without permanent genomic changes. Further refinements, including base editors and prime editors, expand the range of possible edits while minimizing off-target activity and reliance on DSBs, thereby enhancing the specificity and therapeutic applicability of CRISPR-based technologies.",

    "question": "Why is the tumor microenvironment considered a critical factor in cancer progression and metastasis?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) comprises diverse cell types (fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells), signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix components that collectively influence tumor behavior. Cancer cells co-opt these elements to promote angiogenesis (VEGF), evade immune destruction (PD-L1 upregulation), and remodel the ECM (MMPs), facilitating invasion and metastasis. Fibroblasts secrete growth factors (HGF, TGF-β) that enhance tumor cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), can exhibit pro-tumorigenic (M2 polarization) or anti-tumorigenic (M1 polarization) phenotypes depending on cytokine cues within the TME. Hypoxia induces HIF-1α activation, stimulating angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming. Physical properties of the ECM (stiffness, collagen density) also modulate cell signaling and migration. Therapeutic resistance arises from TME-mediated mechanisms, including impaired drug delivery, altered metabolism, and activation of bypass pathways. Targeting the TME represents a promising strategy to disrupt these supportive interactions and improve treatment outcomes.",

  {
    "question": "How do non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression in mammalian cells?",
    "answer": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) exert multifaceted control over gene expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) scaffold protein complexes to chromatin, influencing histone modifications and DNA methylation, thereby modulating transcription. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) can act as miRNA sponges, sequestering miRNAs and preventing them from binding to their mRNA targets. Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) interfere with mRNA translation or stability. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guide chemical modifications of ribosomal RNA. ncRNAs participate in diverse cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and disease pathogenesis. Dysregulation of ncRNA expression or function contributes to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. ncRNA-based therapeutics are under development, aiming to restore normal gene expression patterns and treat various diseases.",

  {
    "question": "What role do chemokines and chemokine receptors play in leukocyte trafficking during inflammation?",
    "answer": "Chemokines are small chemotactic cytokines that bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on leukocytes, directing their migration to sites of inflammation. Chemokines are produced by various cell types, including immune cells, endothelial cells, and stromal cells, in response to inflammatory stimuli. Chemokine receptors, such as CCR2, CCR5, CXCR4, and CXCL12, exhibit differential expression patterns on leukocyte subsets, guiding their specific recruitment to tissues. Chemokine gradients are established at inflammatory sites, attracting leukocytes along the gradient through chemotaxis. Chemokine-receptor interactions trigger intracellular signaling cascades, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements and integrin activation, facilitating leukocyte adhesion and transmigration across the endothelium. Dysregulation of chemokine signaling contributes to chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and atherosclerosis. Targeting chemokine receptors represents a therapeutic strategy to inhibit leukocyte trafficking and reduce inflammation.",

  {
    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination (HR). Mutations in these genes impair the ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks accurately, leading to genomic instability and an increased risk of cancer development. BRCA1 interacts with other proteins to form a complex that participates in DNA repair, DNA replication, transcription, and cell cycle checkpoint control. BRCA2 plays a crucial role in HR by binding to single-stranded DNA and facilitating the recruitment of RAD51 to the site of DNA damage. Loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function results in the accumulation of DNA damage, activation of oncogenes, and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, ultimately driving tumorigenesis. Cells with BRCA1/2 mutations are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors, which block an alternative DNA repair pathway, leading to synthetic lethality. Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 account for a significant proportion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases, and genetic testing is recommended for individuals with a strong family history of these cancers.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade detection and elimination by the host immune system. They rapidly mutate their surface antigens (e.g., influenza virus) to escape antibody recognition, a process known as antigenic drift and shift. Some viruses (e.g., HIV) establish latency, integrating their genome into the host cell's DNA and remaining dormant until reactivated. Viruses can directly interfere with immune signaling pathways, such as blocking interferon production (e.g., influenza virus) or inhibiting antigen presentation (e.g., adenovirus). Several viruses encode proteins that mimic or interfere with cytokine function, modulating the immune response to their advantage. Certain viruses infect and destroy immune cells (e.g., HIV infecting CD4+ T cells). Furthermore, viruses can induce immunosuppression by promoting the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or by secreting immunosuppressive cytokines. Understanding viral immune evasion mechanisms is crucial for developing effective vaccines and antiviral therapies.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors work to treat cancer?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors block inhibitory receptors on T cells, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, which normally suppress T cell activation. Cancer cells often exploit these checkpoints to evade immune destruction. CTLA-4 blockade enhances T cell priming in lymph nodes, while PD-1/PD-L1 blockade reinvigorates T cell effector function within the tumor microenvironment. By blocking these inhibitory signals, checkpoint inhibitors unleash the antitumor activity of T cells, leading to tumor regression in some patients. However, checkpoint blockade can also lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to the activation of T cells against normal tissues. Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB), can help predict response to checkpoint inhibitors, but their predictive value is not perfect. Combination therapies involving checkpoint inhibitors and other modalities (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy) are being explored to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications contribute to the development of age-related diseases?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, accumulate with age and contribute to the development of age-related diseases. DNA methylation patterns change globally with aging, with some regions becoming hypermethylated and others hypomethylated. Histone modifications, such as histone acetylation and methylation, also undergo age-related alterations, affecting chromatin structure and gene expression. These epigenetic changes can disrupt cellular processes, such as DNA repair, mitochondrial function, and immune response, leading to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases. Epigenetic drift, the stochastic accumulation of epigenetic changes over time, contributes to phenotypic heterogeneity and age-related decline. Environmental factors, such as diet and exposure to toxins, can also influence epigenetic modifications and accelerate aging. Targeting epigenetic modifications represents a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay the onset of age-related diseases.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms of action of commonly used anti-cancer drugs such as taxanes and platinum-based agents?",
    "answer": "Taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel) disrupt microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest at metaphase and apoptosis. They bind to β-tubulin, stabilizing microtubules and preventing their depolymerization, which is essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Platinum-based agents (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin) form DNA adducts, causing DNA damage and triggering cell death. These agents crosslink DNA strands, interfering with DNA replication and transcription. The DNA damage response activates cell cycle checkpoints and initiates apoptosis. Both taxanes and platinum-based agents preferentially target rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells, but they can also affect normal cells, leading to side effects such as myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Resistance to these drugs can develop through various mechanisms, including increased drug efflux, mutations in target proteins, and activation of DNA repair pathways.",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence host metabolism and immunity?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome, comprising trillions of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, profoundly influences host metabolism and immunity. Gut microbes ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which serve as energy sources for colonocytes and regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. The microbiome synthesizes essential vitamins (e.g., vitamin K, biotin) and amino acids. It also metabolizes xenobiotics, influencing drug efficacy and toxicity. Gut microbes shape the development and function of the immune system, promoting the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and stimulating the production of IgA antibodies. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiome, is associated with various diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disorders. Modulating the gut microbiome through dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) represents a therapeutic strategy to improve host health.",
