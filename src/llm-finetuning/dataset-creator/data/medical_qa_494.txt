    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR signaling pathway contribute to the development of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Mutations in EGFR, particularly the T790M mutation in exon 20, sterically hinder the binding of first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [PMID:26642253]. This mutation increases the ATP-binding affinity of EGFR, making it less susceptible to inhibition by reversible TKIs. Additionally, activation of bypass pathways, such as MET amplification or activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, can circumvent EGFR inhibition and restore downstream signaling, resulting in acquired resistance. Some patients also develop alternative resistance mechanisms like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or histological transformation to small cell lung cancer. Third-generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib were designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance, but subsequent mutations such as C797S can further impair drug binding and restore EGFR activity. Combinatorial strategies targeting both EGFR and bypass pathways are under investigation to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms by which gut microbiota dysbiosis can influence the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis in IBD is characterized by reduced microbial diversity, decreased abundance of Firmicutes, and increased abundance of Proteobacteria, leading to impaired barrier function, altered immune responses, and metabolic changes. Reduced production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which are essential for colonocyte health and immune regulation, contributes to increased intestinal permeability and inflammation. Dysbiotic bacteria can produce pro-inflammatory metabolites like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin, activating TLR4 and TLR5 signaling pathways, respectively, in immune cells and epithelial cells, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, dysbiosis can disrupt the balance between T helper cells (Th1, Th17) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), promoting a pro-inflammatory immune response and exacerbating intestinal inflammation. Certain bacterial species like adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) can invade intestinal epithelial cells, triggering intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. The specific composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota therefore play a critical role in modulating the immune response and disease progression in IBD.",

    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis?",
    "answer": "Chronic inflammation plays a central role in all stages of atherosclerosis, from initiation to plaque rupture. Endothelial dysfunction induced by risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension triggers the recruitment of monocytes and T lymphocytes into the arterial wall [PMID:11809851]. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which engulf oxidized LDL cholesterol and become foam cells, a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions. Activated macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which further amplify the inflammatory response and promote the recruitment of more immune cells. These cytokines also stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the extracellular matrix and contribute to plaque instability. T lymphocytes, particularly Th1 cells, release IFN-γ, which activates macrophages and promotes a pro-inflammatory environment. Chronic inflammation also impairs the resolution of inflammation and promotes the formation of advanced atherosclerotic plaques with lipid-rich necrotic cores and thin fibrous caps, making them more prone to rupture and thrombosis. Inhibition of inflammatory pathways, such as the IL-1β pathway, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials.",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline [PMID:26954475]. Amyloid plaques are formed by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are generated by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes, which encode components of the γ-secretase complex, increase Aβ production and aggregation. Neurofibrillary tangles are formed by the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which leads to its detachment from microtubules and aggregation into insoluble filaments. Genetic factors, such as APOE4 allele, increase the risk of AD, while APOE2 is protective. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction also contribute to neuronal damage and disease progression. Therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production, aggregation, and clearance, as well as tau phosphorylation and aggregation, are under investigation to prevent or slow down the progression of AD.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host's innate immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to evade the host's innate immune system, which include strategies to interfere with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), block interferon (IFN) production, inhibit IFN signaling, and suppress downstream antiviral responses. Many viruses encode proteins that directly target and inhibit PRRs such as TLRs, RIG-I, and cGAS-STING, preventing the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Some viruses express decoy receptors or soluble proteins that bind to cytokines or chemokines, neutralizing their activity. Several viruses encode proteins that block the activation of transcription factors such as IRF3 and NF-κB, which are essential for IFN production. Viruses can also interfere with IFN signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of STAT proteins, which are critical for the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Some viruses express microRNAs that target host immune genes or encode proteins that directly degrade or inhibit antiviral proteins such as PKR, RNase L, and APOBEC3G. By employing these evasion strategies, viruses can establish persistent infections and cause disease.",

    "question": "What is the role of epigenetic modifications in cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, play a critical role in regulating gene expression and cellular function, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer [PMID:22009439]. DNA methylation, particularly at CpG islands in promoter regions, can silence tumor suppressor genes and contribute to tumorigenesis. Histone modifications, such as histone acetylation and methylation, can alter chromatin structure and accessibility, affecting gene transcription. Aberrant histone modifications can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play a role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can be targeted by epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which have shown promise in cancer therapy. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications can influence drug resistance and immune evasion in cancer.",

    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly impacts the efficacy of immunotherapy by modulating immune cell infiltration, function, and survival [PMID:28886329]. Immunosuppressive cells within the TME, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), can inhibit T cell activation and promote immune evasion. Factors secreted by tumor cells and stromal cells, such as TGF-β, IL-10, and VEGF, can further suppress immune responses and promote angiogenesis. Physical barriers within the TME, such as dense extracellular matrix and abnormal vasculature, can limit immune cell infiltration and drug delivery. Furthermore, the TME can influence the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, on tumor cells and immune cells, leading to T cell exhaustion and impaired anti-tumor immunity. Strategies to modulate the TME, such as targeting immunosuppressive cells, inhibiting angiogenesis, and remodeling the extracellular matrix, are being investigated to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease?",
    "answer": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Several signaling pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation [PMID:21474837]. Oxidative stress, caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased antioxidant defenses, can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. Mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting from mutations in mitochondrial DNA or impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, can impair energy production and increase ROS generation. Neuroinflammation, mediated by activated microglia and astrocytes, can release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, contributing to neuronal damage. Protein aggregation, particularly of alpha-synuclein, can form Lewy bodies, a hallmark of PD, and disrupt neuronal function. Genetic factors, such as mutations in SNCA, LRRK2, and PARK2 genes, can also contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Therapeutic strategies targeting these signaling pathways are under investigation to prevent or slow down the progression of PD.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs through diverse mechanisms, including increased drug efflux, decreased drug uptake, altered drug metabolism, target gene mutation, activation of survival pathways, and DNA repair [PMID:17185725]. Increased expression of drug efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (MDR1), can reduce intracellular drug concentrations and decrease drug efficacy. Decreased expression of drug uptake transporters can also limit drug entry into cancer cells. Altered drug metabolism, through increased inactivation or decreased activation of chemotherapy drugs, can reduce drug efficacy. Target gene mutations can alter the binding affinity of chemotherapy drugs and render them ineffective. Activation of survival pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways, can promote cell survival and resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs. Increased DNA repair capacity can protect cancer cells from DNA damage caused by chemotherapy drugs. Furthermore, cancer cells can develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs through epigenetic modifications and changes in the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapies and targeted therapies are being developed to overcome chemotherapy resistance.",

    "question": "What are the key differences between humoral and cell-mediated immunity?",
    "answer": "Humoral immunity involves the production of antibodies by B cells to neutralize extracellular pathogens, while cell-mediated immunity involves the activation of T cells to directly kill infected cells or activate other immune cells [PMID:10692864]. Humoral immunity is primarily effective against extracellular bacteria, viruses, and toxins, while cell-mediated immunity is essential for eliminating intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, and for rejecting transplanted organs and fighting cancer. Antibodies produced by B cells can neutralize pathogens, opsonize pathogens for phagocytosis, or activate the complement system. T cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and helper T cells (Th cells), recognize antigens presented on MHC molecules. CTLs directly kill infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules, while Th cells secrete cytokines that activate other immune cells, such as macrophages and B cells. Humoral and cell-mediated immunity are interconnected and work together to provide comprehensive immune protection.",
