    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work at a molecular level?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 employs a guide RNA (gRNA) that complements a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The gRNA directs the Cas9 endonuclease to that location, where Cas9 creates a double-stranded break in the DNA. The cell attempts to repair this break via either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can introduce insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt the gene, or homology-directed repair (HDR) if a DNA template with the desired sequence is provided. HDR allows for precise gene editing by copying the template sequence into the break site. The efficiency and specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 are determined by the design of the gRNA and the delivery method of the Cas9 protein and gRNA into the cell.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in IBD pathogenesis through several mechanisms. Dysbiosis, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and altered composition, disrupts the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory bacterial species. Specific bacteria, such as adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) in Crohn's disease, can exacerbate inflammation by colonizing the intestinal mucosa and triggering an immune response. Conversely, a deficiency in beneficial bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which produces anti-inflammatory metabolites like butyrate, contributes to impaired gut barrier function and increased inflammation. The microbiome also influences the development and function of the intestinal immune system, with microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) activating pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune cells, leading to cytokine production. Genetic factors, such as NOD2 mutations, can impair the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to handle bacteria, further promoting inflammation. Therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, aim to restore microbial balance and reduce inflammation in IBD patients.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop cisplatin resistance through multiple mechanisms acting in concert. Increased DNA repair capacity, particularly nucleotide excision repair (NER), allows cells to rapidly repair cisplatin-induced DNA damage, preventing apoptosis. Reduced drug uptake, often mediated by decreased expression of copper transporter protein 1 (CTR1), limits intracellular cisplatin accumulation. Enhanced drug efflux, mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCC2 (MRP2), actively pumps cisplatin out of the cell. Increased levels of glutathione (GSH) and metallothioneins detoxify cisplatin by forming non-toxic complexes. Alterations in apoptotic pathways, such as downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BAX) and upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BCL-2), prevent cisplatin from triggering cell death. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications and activation of survival signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/AKT/mTOR) can contribute to cisplatin resistance. Combination therapies targeting multiple resistance mechanisms are being explored to overcome cisplatin resistance.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transporting proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA) between cells. In cancer, exosomes play a significant role in promoting metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes can alter the tumor microenvironment by delivering pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF) to endothelial cells, promoting blood vessel formation and facilitating tumor cell intravasation. Exosomes can also educate distant pre-metastatic niches by delivering proteins and microRNAs that prepare these sites for tumor cell colonization. For example, exosomes carrying matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can remodel the extracellular matrix, while exosomes containing specific microRNAs can suppress the expression of tumor suppressor genes in recipient cells. Furthermore, exosomes can mediate immune suppression by delivering immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., PD-L1) to immune cells, inhibiting their anti-tumor activity. Exosomes also contribute to drug resistance by transferring resistance-conferring factors to sensitive cells. Targeting exosome biogenesis, secretion, or uptake is being explored as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit cancer metastasis.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 antibodies enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) antibodies, enhance anti-tumor immunity by blocking inhibitory signaling pathways that normally suppress T-cell activation and effector function. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, which binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells. This interaction delivers an inhibitory signal to the T cell, preventing it from attacking the tumor cell. Anti-PD-1 antibodies block this interaction, allowing T cells to become activated and kill tumor cells. By blocking PD-1 signaling, anti-PD-1 antibodies promote T-cell proliferation, increase cytokine production (e.g., IFN-γ), and enhance cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Checkpoint inhibitors can unleash pre-existing anti-tumor T-cell responses and promote the development of new responses. However, checkpoint inhibitors can also cause immune-related adverse events due to the activation of T cells against normal tissues. Predictive biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and microsatellite instability (MSI), are used to identify patients who are more likely to respond to checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Several signaling pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which aggregate to form plaques. The accumulation of Aβ triggers a cascade of events, including activation of kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which hyperphosphorylate tau protein, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles disrupt microtubule function and neuronal transport. Aβ also activates inflammatory pathways, leading to microglial activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction further contribute to neuronal damage. Insulin signaling is also impaired in AD, leading to reduced glucose uptake and energy metabolism in the brain. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), affect Aβ production and aggregation. Therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways are under development to prevent or slow the progression of AD.",

    "question": "How do viruses like HIV evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses, such as HIV, employ multiple strategies to evade the host immune system. HIV exhibits high genetic variability due to its reverse transcriptase enzyme's error-prone nature, resulting in rapid mutation and antigenic variation, allowing it to escape antibody recognition. HIV infects and depletes CD4+ T cells, which are crucial for coordinating immune responses. The virus also establishes latency in resting CD4+ T cells, forming a viral reservoir that is not targeted by the immune system or antiviral drugs. HIV encodes proteins that interfere with antigen presentation, such as Nef, which downregulates MHC class I expression on infected cells, preventing cytotoxic T-cell recognition. HIV also produces proteins that inhibit complement activation and NK cell activity. Furthermore, HIV induces immune dysfunction, leading to chronic immune activation, T-cell exhaustion, and impaired dendritic cell function. The virus also manipulates cytokine production, promoting immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β. These mechanisms enable HIV to persist in the host despite a strong immune response.",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms underlying the development of type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) develops due to a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, leading to insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Insulin resistance, primarily in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, results from defects in insulin signaling pathways. These defects include reduced expression of insulin receptors, impaired phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and decreased activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6) contribute to insulin resistance. Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction is characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Initially, beta cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production. However, over time, beta cells become exhausted and undergo apoptosis due to glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity. Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in genes involved in insulin signaling, beta-cell function, and glucose metabolism, increase susceptibility to T2D. Epigenetic modifications and alterations in the gut microbiome also contribute to T2D pathogenesis. The combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion leads to hyperglycemia and the development of T2D.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with CAR T-cells work in treating hematological malignancies?",
    "answer": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's T cells to express a CAR, which is a synthetic receptor that recognizes a specific antigen on tumor cells. Typically, CAR T-cells are designed to target CD19, a protein expressed on B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. The CAR consists of an extracellular antigen-binding domain (usually a single-chain variable fragment or scFv derived from an antibody), a transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains (CD3ζ and costimulatory domains such as CD28 or 4-1BB). The patient's T cells are collected via leukapheresis, genetically modified to express the CAR using viral vectors, expanded ex vivo, and then infused back into the patient. Upon encountering tumor cells expressing the target antigen, the CAR T-cells become activated, releasing cytotoxic granules (perforin and granzymes) that kill the tumor cells. CAR T-cells also secrete cytokines that enhance the anti-tumor immune response. CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in treating relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. However, CAR T-cell therapy can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, which require careful management. Strategies to improve CAR T-cell therapy include developing CARs with improved specificity and reducing off-target effects, enhancing CAR T-cell persistence, and overcoming resistance mechanisms.",

    "question": "What is the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play diverse regulatory roles in gene expression. In cancer, lncRNAs are frequently dysregulated and can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. LncRNAs regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional processing. Some lncRNAs act as scaffolds, bringing together different proteins to regulate gene expression. For example, lncRNA HOTAIR recruits the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to silence tumor suppressor genes. Other lncRNAs act as decoys, binding to microRNAs and preventing them from inhibiting their target mRNAs. LncRNAs can also regulate mRNA stability and translation. Dysregulation of lncRNAs has been implicated in various cancer processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance. LncRNAs can also influence the tumor microenvironment and immune response. Targeting lncRNAs is being explored as a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer. However, the mechanisms of action of many lncRNAs are still poorly understood, and further research is needed to elucidate their roles in cancer development and progression.",
