    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR gene contribute to the development of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Mutations in EGFR, particularly the T790M mutation, confer resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by increasing the affinity of EGFR for ATP, thus outcompeting the TKI. Additionally, mutations such as C797S in cis with T790M can further disrupt binding of third-generation TKIs like osimertinib. Alternative mechanisms of resistance involve activation of bypass pathways such as MET amplification or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which reduce dependence on EGFR signaling. Furthermore, histological transformation to small cell lung cancer can occur, rendering EGFR-targeted therapies ineffective. Combination strategies targeting both EGFR and bypass pathways, as well as development of novel TKIs that overcome T790M and C797S, are under investigation to address these resistance mechanisms.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by influencing systemic immunity and anti-tumor responses. Certain bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved response rates and progression-free survival in patients treated with ICIs. These bacteria can enhance T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment and promote a pro-inflammatory immune milieu, increasing the sensitivity of tumors to ICIs. Conversely, dysbiosis and the presence of certain other bacterial species can lead to immune suppression and reduced ICI efficacy. The mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences ICI response include modulation of dendritic cell maturation, activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that regulate T-cell function. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions aimed at enriching beneficial bacteria are being explored as strategies to enhance ICI efficacy and overcome resistance.",

    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?",
    "answer": "Chronic inflammation is a central driver of atherosclerosis through multiple mechanisms. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 promote endothelial dysfunction, increasing permeability to lipoproteins and adhesion of monocytes. Oxidized LDL accumulates in the subendothelial space, triggering an inflammatory response that recruits monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages and engulf the lipids, forming foam cells. These foam cells contribute to plaque formation and release inflammatory mediators, perpetuating the cycle of inflammation and lipid accumulation. Furthermore, inflammation activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the extracellular matrix, destabilizing the plaque and increasing the risk of rupture and thrombosis. The CANTOS trial demonstrated that targeting IL-1β with canakinumab reduces cardiovascular events, highlighting the causal role of inflammation in atherosclerosis. Emerging therapies aimed at resolving inflammation and promoting plaque stability are being investigated to prevent and treat atherosclerotic disease.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Several signaling pathways are implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Aberrant cleavage of APP by β-secretase and γ-secretase leads to the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, which trigger a cascade of downstream events. Aβ oligomers disrupt synaptic function, induce oxidative stress, and activate microglia and astrocytes, leading to chronic neuroinflammation. Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein results in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which impair axonal transport and neuronal survival. Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, insulin signaling, and Wnt signaling also contribute to AD pathogenesis. Genetic factors such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), as well as the APOE4 allele, increase the risk of AD by modulating these signaling pathways. Therapies targeting Aβ production, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation are under development to slow down the progression of AD.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications influence gene expression and contribute to cancer development?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, play a critical role in regulating gene expression and contributing to cancer development. DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands, leads to gene silencing by recruiting methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, alter chromatin structure and accessibility, influencing transcription. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In cancer, aberrant epigenetic modifications can lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes, promoting uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. For example, hypermethylation of the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4A is frequently observed in various cancers. Epigenetic therapies, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and HDAC inhibitors, are being developed to reverse these aberrant epigenetic modifications and restore normal gene expression patterns in cancer cells.",

    "question": "How does the adaptive immune system contribute to the control of viral infections?",
    "answer": "The adaptive immune system plays a critical role in controlling viral infections through the coordinated action of T cells and B cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize viral antigens presented on MHC class I molecules and kill infected cells, thereby eliminating the source of viral replication. Helper T cells (Th cells) secrete cytokines that enhance the activity of CTLs and B cells, and promote inflammation to clear the infection. B cells produce antibodies that neutralize viruses, prevent viral entry into cells, and facilitate viral clearance through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation. The generation of memory T cells and B cells provides long-lasting immunity against subsequent encounters with the same virus. The specificity of the adaptive immune response allows for targeted elimination of infected cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. However, in some cases, excessive or dysregulated adaptive immune responses can contribute to immunopathology and disease severity.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes impair DNA repair mechanisms, specifically homologous recombination repair (HRR), leading to genomic instability and increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are involved in repairing double-strand DNA breaks, which can arise from DNA damage caused by environmental factors or normal cellular processes. When these genes are mutated, damaged DNA is not repaired accurately, leading to the accumulation of mutations and an increased risk of cancer development. Cells with BRCA1/2 mutations are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors, which block another DNA repair pathway, leading to synthetic lethality. Moreover, BRCA1 and BRCA2 also play roles in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control, further contributing to their tumor suppressor functions. Individuals with BRCA1/2 mutations have a significantly higher lifetime risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers compared to the general population.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. In cancer, exosomes play a crucial role in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes can transfer oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to recipient cells, altering their phenotype and promoting tumor progression. Exosomes can also deliver immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells, inhibiting their anti-tumor activity and facilitating immune evasion. In the context of metastasis, exosomes can prepare the pre-metastatic niche by remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting angiogenesis, and attracting immune cells to distant sites. Moreover, exosomes can transport drug resistance factors to recipient cells, contributing to therapeutic resistance. Exosomes hold promise as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host's innate immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade the host's innate immune system, enabling them to replicate and spread. Some viruses encode proteins that interfere with the production or signaling of type I interferons (IFNs), which are crucial for antiviral defense. For instance, certain viral proteins can inhibit the activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) or block the binding of IFNs to their receptors. Other viruses encode proteins that inhibit the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which are essential for detecting viral nucleic acids and initiating antiviral responses. Additionally, viruses can express decoy receptors that bind to cytokines or chemokines, preventing them from activating immune cells. Some viruses also encode proteins that inhibit the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which are important for eliminating virus-infected cells. These evasion mechanisms allow viruses to establish persistent infections and cause disease.",

    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers transformative potential for treating genetic diseases by enabling precise and targeted modifications of the genome. It can be used to correct disease-causing mutations, disrupt the expression of harmful genes, or insert therapeutic genes into specific locations. In ex vivo gene therapy, cells are harvested from the patient, genetically modified using CRISPR-Cas9, and then transplanted back into the patient. This approach has shown promise in treating blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia. In vivo gene therapy involves directly delivering CRISPR-Cas9 components into the patient's body to target specific tissues or organs. This approach is being explored for treating diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. However, challenges remain, including off-target effects, delivery efficiency, and immune responses to CRISPR-Cas9 components. Ongoing research focuses on improving the specificity and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to realize its full potential for treating a wide range of genetic diseases.",
