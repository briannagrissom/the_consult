    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 technology facilitate targeted gene editing in mammalian cells?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 employs a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a specific DNA sequence, directing the Cas9 nuclease to that site in the genome. Cas9 induces a double-stranded break (DSB) at the target location. The cell repairs this break via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can introduce insertions or deletions (indels), effectively disrupting the gene. Alternatively, if a DNA template homologous to the target site is provided, the cell can use homology-directed repair (HDR) to precisely insert or modify the gene sequence. The efficiency of HDR is lower than NHEJ and depends on factors like cell type and template design. Off-target effects, where Cas9 cuts at unintended sites with sequence similarity to the gRNA, remain a significant concern, but can be mitigated using optimized gRNAs, Cas9 variants with higher specificity, and careful bioinformatic analysis. CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized gene editing by offering a simpler, more efficient, and more versatile approach compared to previous methods like TALENs and zinc finger nucleases.",

    "question": "What role does the gut microbiome play in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome is a critical factor in IBD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis, characterized by decreased microbial diversity and altered composition, is consistently observed in IBD patients. Specifically, there is often a reduction in beneficial commensal bacteria, such as Firmicutes, and an increase in pathobionts like Escherichia coli. These changes disrupt the gut's homeostasis, impairing the intestinal barrier function and increasing permeability, allowing bacterial products to translocate and activate the immune system. Furthermore, specific bacterial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers, are reduced in IBD. SCFAs like butyrate have anti-inflammatory properties and support intestinal epithelial cell health. Certain bacterial species can also produce pro-inflammatory molecules that exacerbate IBD, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin. Genetic factors, diet, and environmental influences interact to shape the microbiome and its impact on IBD. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is being investigated as a therapeutic approach to restore a healthy microbiome in IBD patients, although its long-term efficacy and safety are still under evaluation.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that block inhibitory signaling pathways that normally dampen T cell activation and effector function. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are key immune checkpoints. CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, competes with the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), preventing full T cell activation. PD-1, also on T cells, binds to PD-L1 or PD-L2 expressed on tumor cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment, delivering an inhibitory signal that suppresses T cell cytotoxicity. By blocking CTLA-4 or the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, checkpoint inhibitors unleash T cell activity, allowing them to recognize and kill cancer cells. The efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors varies depending on tumor type, mutational burden, and the presence of pre-existing anti-tumor immunity. Combination therapies targeting multiple checkpoints or combining checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy or radiation therapy are being explored to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance.",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Amyloid plaques are formed by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Aβ plaques trigger neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules. Hyperphosphorylation causes tau to detach from microtubules and aggregate, disrupting axonal transport and leading to neuronal death. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), increase Aβ production and promote early-onset AD. The APOE4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction also contribute to AD pathogenesis. Current therapeutic strategies target Aβ production or clearance, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, but effective treatments remain elusive.",

    "question": "How does metformin exert its anti-hyperglycemic effects in type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, which in turn suppresses the expression of genes involved in glucose production. Metformin also improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, such as muscle, by increasing glucose uptake and utilization. Additionally, it may have some effects on the gut microbiome and incretin hormone secretion, contributing to its overall glucose-lowering effect. Metformin is generally well-tolerated but can cause gastrointestinal side effects. It is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment due to the risk of lactic acidosis, although the risk is lower than previously thought. Metformin remains the first-line oral medication for type 2 diabetes due to its efficacy, safety, and low cost.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Cancer metastasis is a complex process involving multiple steps, including detachment from the primary tumor, invasion of surrounding tissues, intravasation into blood or lymphatic vessels, survival in circulation, extravasation at a distant site, and colonization to form a secondary tumor. Several signaling pathways play critical roles in these steps. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process that allows cancer cells to lose their cell-cell adhesion and acquire migratory and invasive properties. EMT is driven by transcription factors such as SNAIL, TWIST, and ZEB1, which are regulated by signaling pathways like TGF-β, Wnt, and Notch. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix, facilitating invasion. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. The VEGF pathway promotes angiogenesis. Chemokines and their receptors, such as CXCR4 and CCL5, guide cancer cell migration and homing to specific metastatic sites. Understanding these signaling pathways is crucial for developing therapies to prevent or treat metastasis.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host's immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade the host's immune system. They can interfere with interferon (IFN) signaling, a critical antiviral defense mechanism. Some viruses encode proteins that inhibit IFN production or block the downstream signaling pathways activated by IFN. Viruses can also suppress antigen presentation, reducing the ability of T cells to recognize and eliminate infected cells. They may downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules, which present viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Some viruses establish latency, remaining dormant within host cells without actively replicating, thus avoiding immune detection. Viruses also exhibit high mutation rates, allowing them to rapidly evolve and escape antibody recognition. For example, influenza virus undergoes antigenic drift and antigenic shift, leading to seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Some viruses directly target and kill immune cells, such as HIV, which infects and destroys CD4+ T cells. Understanding viral immune evasion mechanisms is essential for developing effective vaccines and antiviral therapies.",

    "question": "What is the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play diverse regulatory roles in gene expression. They are frequently dysregulated in cancer and contribute to various aspects of tumor development and progression. LncRNAs can act as scaffolds, bringing together different proteins to regulate transcription, chromatin remodeling, and RNA processing. They can also act as decoys, binding to proteins or RNAs and preventing them from interacting with their normal targets. Some lncRNAs act as guides, directing proteins to specific genomic locations. For example, the lncRNA HOTAIR promotes metastasis by recruiting the PRC2 complex to silence tumor suppressor genes. The lncRNA MALAT1 promotes angiogenesis and tumor growth. LncRNAs can also regulate microRNA (miRNA) activity by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), sequestering miRNAs and preventing them from binding to their target mRNAs. LncRNAs are being explored as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers in cancer.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination repair (HRR). They play a critical role in maintaining genomic stability. When DNA damage occurs, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are recruited to the site of damage to facilitate accurate repair. Mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 impair HRR, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability. This increases the risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers. Cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations become reliant on alternative, error-prone DNA repair pathways, making them more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents such as platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors block another DNA repair pathway, base excision repair (BER), causing synthetic lethality in cells with defective HRR. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that individuals with one copy of the mutated gene have an increased risk of cancer. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is recommended for individuals with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer.",

    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) that are secreted by cells and mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNAs and microRNAs) to recipient cells. Exosomes play diverse roles in cancer development and progression. Cancer cells release exosomes that can promote angiogenesis, immune suppression, metastasis, and drug resistance. Exosomes can transfer oncogenes and signaling molecules to recipient cells, altering their behavior and promoting tumor growth. They can also transfer microRNAs that regulate gene expression in recipient cells. For example, exosomes can transfer drug resistance-related proteins or microRNAs to sensitive cells, making them resistant to chemotherapy. Exosomes can also modulate the tumor microenvironment by recruiting immune cells and promoting inflammation. Exosomes are being explored as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as therapeutic targets for drug delivery. Exosomes derived from healthy cells are also being investigated as a means of delivering therapeutic agents to cancer cells.",
