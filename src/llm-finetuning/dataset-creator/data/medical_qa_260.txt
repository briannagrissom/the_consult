    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain lead to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) commonly arises from secondary mutations within the EGFR kinase domain itself. The most frequent resistance mechanism is the T790M mutation, where threonine at position 790 is replaced by methionine. This mutation sterically hinders the binding of reversible EGFR TKIs, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, by increasing the affinity of EGFR for ATP. Consequently, higher concentrations of the drug are required to achieve effective EGFR inhibition, rendering the original TKI ineffective. Other less common resistance mutations, like C797S, L792H, or exon 20 insertions, also disrupt drug binding or alter the kinase domain conformation, preventing effective EGFR inhibition. In addition, bypass signaling pathways, such as MET amplification, HER2 amplification, or activation of PI3K/AKT, can independently drive tumor cell growth and survival, circumventing the need for EGFR signaling. Development of third-generation EGFR TKIs, like osimertinib, which covalently bind to EGFR and are less sensitive to the T790M mutation, has improved outcomes in T790M-positive NSCLC. However, resistance to osimertinib can also emerge through mechanisms like C797S mutations or activation of alternative signaling pathways, underscoring the ongoing challenge of overcoming adaptive resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer.",

    "question": "Why are viral vectors commonly used for gene therapy, and what are some of the limitations?",
    "answer": "Viral vectors are widely employed in gene therapy due to their inherent ability to efficiently deliver genetic material into target cells. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are favored for their low immunogenicity and broad tropism, while lentiviruses are used for stable integration of transgenes into the host genome. Adenoviruses offer high transduction efficiency but can elicit stronger immune responses. However, viral vectors have limitations. Insertional mutagenesis, where the viral vector integrates into an unintended location in the genome, can disrupt normal gene function or activate oncogenes, although newer vectors with targeted integration capabilities are mitigating this risk. Immunogenicity remains a concern, as pre-existing antibodies or de novo immune responses against viral capsid proteins can limit transduction efficiency and lead to inflammation or even vector-induced toxicity. Manufacturing and scalability of viral vectors present significant challenges, with high production costs and limited capacity hindering widespread clinical application. Furthermore, the size of the transgene that can be packaged into a viral vector is constrained, limiting the use of vectors for delivering large genes or complex gene regulatory elements. Despite these limitations, ongoing research focuses on developing safer, more efficient, and scalable viral vectors for gene therapy, including capsid engineering to reduce immunogenicity, promoter optimization for targeted expression, and improved manufacturing processes to lower production costs.",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer therapy through complex interactions with the host immune system. Certain bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved responses to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies. These bacteria can enhance antitumor immunity by promoting the maturation and activation of dendritic cells, leading to increased T-cell priming and infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiome, has been linked to reduced ICI efficacy and increased immune-related adverse events. For example, the presence of certain Bacteroides species has been associated with colitis during anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Mechanistically, the gut microbiome influences systemic immunity through the production of metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can modulate immune cell function. SCFAs like butyrate can enhance T-cell activity and suppress regulatory T-cell function. Furthermore, microbial components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on immune cells, triggering inflammatory responses. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being investigated to improve ICI efficacy and reduce toxicity. FMT from responders to non-responders has shown promise in preclinical models and early clinical trials. Overall, the gut microbiome represents a modifiable factor that can significantly impact the outcome of cancer immunotherapy.",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves complex interactions among amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Aβ plaques, formed by the aggregation of Aβ peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase, trigger a cascade of events leading to neuronal damage. Aβ oligomers, more than insoluble plaques, are highly neurotoxic, disrupting synaptic plasticity and inducing oxidative stress. NFTs, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, destabilize microtubules, impair axonal transport, and contribute to neuronal death. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is mediated by kinases like GSK-3β and CDK5. Neuroinflammation, driven by activated microglia and astrocytes, exacerbates neuronal damage through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α) and reactive oxygen species. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, increase Aβ production, while the APOE4 allele enhances Aβ aggregation and clearance. Synaptic loss, occurring early in AD, is strongly correlated with cognitive decline. Aβ oligomers and tau pathology disrupt synaptic transmission and plasticity by interfering with neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways. Emerging research highlights the role of impaired glucose metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal dysfunction in AD pathogenesis. Therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic protection are under development to slow or prevent AD progression.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with CAR T-cells work, and what are its limitations?",
    "answer": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's T-cells to express a synthetic receptor that recognizes a specific antigen on tumor cells. The CAR typically consists of an extracellular antigen-binding domain (e.g., a single-chain variable fragment, scFv) fused to intracellular signaling domains that activate T-cell function upon antigen recognition. After ex vivo engineering and expansion, CAR T-cells are infused back into the patient, where they can specifically target and kill tumor cells expressing the target antigen. CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in treating certain hematological malignancies, such as B-cell lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to high remission rates. However, CAR T-cell therapy faces several limitations. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a systemic inflammatory response caused by the release of cytokines from activated CAR T-cells and other immune cells, is a common and potentially life-threatening toxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), can also occur. On-target, off-tumor toxicity, where CAR T-cells attack normal cells expressing the target antigen, can lead to severe complications. Antigen escape, where tumor cells lose expression of the target antigen, can result in disease relapse. Manufacturing CAR T-cells is complex and expensive, limiting accessibility. Solid tumors present a greater challenge due to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and limited CAR T-cell trafficking. Strategies to improve CAR T-cell efficacy and reduce toxicity include optimizing CAR design, developing strategies to overcome immunosuppression, and improving CAR T-cell trafficking to solid tumors.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA), and lipids to recipient cells. In cancer, exosomes play a crucial role in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes can deliver oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to recipient cells, altering their phenotype and promoting tumor progression. For example, exosomes can transfer matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to stromal cells, enhancing extracellular matrix remodeling and facilitating tumor invasion. Exosomes can also promote angiogenesis by delivering pro-angiogenic factors like VEGF to endothelial cells. Immune evasion is facilitated by exosomes carrying immunosuppressive molecules like PD-L1, which inhibit T-cell activation. Moreover, exosomes play a critical role in cancer metastasis by preparing the pre-metastatic niche. Tumor-derived exosomes can travel to distant organs and remodel the microenvironment to create a favorable setting for tumor cell colonization. They can deliver integrins that determine the organ tropism of metastasis and recruit immune cells that suppress anti-tumor immunity. Exosomes are also being explored as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as their cargo reflects the molecular composition of the originating tumor cells. Therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting exosome biogenesis or uptake are being investigated to prevent cancer metastasis.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, influence gene expression and contribute to disease development?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine bases, is typically associated with gene silencing. DNA methylation often occurs at CpG dinucleotides and is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Histone modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, alter chromatin structure and accessibility, thereby influencing gene transcription. Histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes gene expression by relaxing chromatin structure, while histone deacetylation, catalyzed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), leads to chromatin condensation and gene repression. Histone methylation can either activate or repress gene expression, depending on the specific lysine residue that is methylated and the number of methyl groups added. Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in normal development, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and autoimmune diseases. In cancer, epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes contribute to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, are used to reverse abnormal epigenetic patterns and restore normal gene expression in cancer cells. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications are influenced by environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins, highlighting the interplay between genetics and environment in disease etiology.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, driven by complex interactions among multiple signaling pathways. Insulin signaling, initiated by insulin binding to its receptor, activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and inhibition of gluconeogenesis. In insulin-resistant states, impaired insulin receptor signaling and downstream pathway activation reduce glucose disposal and promote hyperglycemia. The AMPK pathway, activated by energy stress, enhances glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Reduced AMPK activity contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. The mTOR pathway, activated by nutrient availability and growth factors, promotes cell growth and proliferation. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling in T2D contributes to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Inflammatory pathways, activated by obesity and hyperglycemia, contribute to insulin resistance and beta-cell apoptosis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, activate the JNK and IKK pathways, which interfere with insulin signaling. The glucagon signaling pathway, activated by low glucose levels, stimulates hepatic glucose production. In T2D, elevated glucagon levels exacerbate hyperglycemia. The incretin pathway, activated by gut hormones like GLP-1 and GIP, enhances insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion. Impaired incretin signaling contributes to beta-cell dysfunction in T2D. Therapeutic strategies targeting these signaling pathways, such as insulin sensitizers, insulin secretagogues, and GLP-1 receptor agonists, are used to manage T2D.",

    "question": "How does the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to cancer progression and therapeutic resistance?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem surrounding tumor cells, comprising stromal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells), extracellular matrix (ECM), growth factors, cytokines, and metabolites. The TME plays a critical role in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secrete growth factors and ECM components that promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. They also remodel the ECM, creating a physical barrier that limits drug penetration. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can either promote or suppress tumor growth, depending on their polarization state. M2-polarized TAMs secrete immunosuppressive cytokines and promote angiogenesis, whereas M1-polarized TAMs exhibit anti-tumor activity. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) suppress anti-tumor immunity, allowing tumor cells to evade immune destruction. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) suppress T-cell activity and promote angiogenesis. The ECM provides structural support for tumor cells and serves as a reservoir for growth factors. ECM remodeling enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis. Hypoxia, a common feature of the TME, promotes angiogenesis and metabolic adaptation. Tumor cells adapt to hypoxia by activating the HIF-1 pathway, which induces the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, and cell survival. Acidosis, another feature of the TME, promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Therapeutic resistance is often mediated by the TME. Stromal cells can secrete factors that protect tumor cells from chemotherapy and radiation. The ECM can limit drug penetration. Hypoxia can reduce the effectiveness of radiation therapy. Strategies to target the TME, such as inhibiting angiogenesis, depleting immunosuppressive cells, and remodeling the ECM, are being explored to improve cancer therapy.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms by which cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs through diverse mechanisms, including altered drug metabolism, increased drug efflux, target alterations, DNA repair enhancement, and evasion of apoptosis. Increased expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450s, can inactivate chemotherapy drugs before they reach their intracellular targets. Overexpression of drug efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cell, reducing their intracellular concentration and efficacy. Mutations in the drug target can prevent drug binding and inhibit its activity. For example, mutations in the EGFR kinase domain can confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Enhanced DNA repair mechanisms allow cancer cells to repair DNA damage induced by chemotherapy drugs, reducing their cytotoxic effects. Increased expression of DNA repair enzymes, such as ERCC1, contributes to chemoresistance. Evasion of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a key mechanism of chemoresistance. Cancer cells can acquire mutations that disable apoptotic pathways, such as inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 or upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with increased chemoresistance. EMT is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell-cell adhesion and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, making them more resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Activation of survival signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, can protect cancer cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can also regulate chemoresistance by modulating the expression of genes involved in drug metabolism, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Strategies to overcome chemoresistance include developing new drugs that bypass resistance mechanisms, combining chemotherapy with targeted therapies that inhibit resistance pathways, and using drug delivery systems that enhance drug accumulation in tumor cells.",
