    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 technology facilitate targeted gene editing in mammalian cells, and what are the key considerations for minimizing off-target effects?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a target DNA sequence, directing the Cas9 nuclease to create a double-strand break. Repair mechanisms, either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR), introduce insertions/deletions or precise edits, respectively. Minimizing off-target effects involves careful gRNA design using algorithms to predict specificity scores, optimizing Cas9 dosage and delivery methods (e.g., ribonucleoprotein complexes), and utilizing Cas9 variants with enhanced specificity (e.g., SpCas9-HF1 or eSpCas9). Whole-genome sequencing or targeted deep sequencing of predicted off-target sites can assess and validate the fidelity of gene editing [PMID: 25439718].",

    "question": "Why is immunotherapy more effective in some cancers than others, and what factors contribute to innate or acquired resistance?",
    "answer": "Immunotherapy efficacy varies due to tumor mutational burden (TMB), pre-existing immune cell infiltration, and immunosuppressive mechanisms. High TMB leads to increased neoantigen presentation, enhancing T-cell recognition. Tumors with 'hot' immune microenvironments (pre-existing CD8+ T cells) respond better than 'cold' tumors lacking infiltration. Resistance arises from loss of antigen presentation via MHC downregulation, upregulation of inhibitory ligands (PD-L1, CTLA-4) on tumor cells or immune cells, recruitment of immunosuppressive cells (Tregs, MDSCs), and activation of alternative immune checkpoints (TIM-3, LAG-3). Intrinsic resistance can result from mutations in interferon signaling pathways or DNA repair genes, limiting immune responsiveness. Combination strategies targeting multiple immune evasion mechanisms are being investigated to overcome resistance [PMID: 29107424].",

    "question": "What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and how do they contribute to neurodegeneration?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Aβ plaques form from sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase, generating Aβ42, which aggregates into oligomers and fibrils, triggering inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Tau hyperphosphorylation disrupts microtubule stability, leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation and impaired axonal transport. These processes induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate receptors. Neuroinflammation, driven by activated microglia and astrocytes, further amplifies neuronal damage through cytokine release and reactive oxygen species production. Genetic factors like APOE4 and mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 influence Aβ production and clearance, increasing AD risk [PMID: 29301942].",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, regulate gene expression in cancer cells, and what are the therapeutic implications?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands, represses gene transcription by recruiting methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), promotes open chromatin and gene expression, while deacetylation by HDACs leads to chromatin condensation and repression. In cancer, aberrant methylation silences tumor suppressor genes, while altered histone modifications dysregulate oncogene expression. Therapeutic strategies involve DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) like azacitidine and decitabine, which reverse DNA methylation, and HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) like vorinostat and romidepsin, which restore histone acetylation patterns, reactivating silenced genes and inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in cancer cells. Combination therapies targeting both DNA methylation and histone modifications are under investigation to enhance efficacy [PMID: 26416758].",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence host immunity and susceptibility to infectious diseases, and what are the potential therapeutic interventions?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome shapes host immunity through various mechanisms, including colonization resistance against pathogens, stimulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and production of metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs, such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate, enhance gut barrier integrity, modulate immune cell function, and reduce inflammation. Dysbiosis, or imbalance in the gut microbiota, disrupts these processes, increasing susceptibility to infections like Clostridioides difficile and inflammatory bowel diseases. Therapeutic interventions include fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which restores microbial diversity and function, prebiotics that selectively promote beneficial bacteria, probiotics that introduce specific microbial strains, and postbiotics that deliver microbial metabolites directly. Modulation of the gut microbiome holds promise for preventing and treating infectious and inflammatory diseases [PMID: 30224636].",

    "question": "How does RNA interference (RNAi) silence gene expression, and what are its applications in gene therapy and drug discovery?",
    "answer": "RNA interference (RNAi) silences gene expression through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target specific mRNA sequences. The siRNA is processed by Dicer into a double-stranded RNA, which is then unwound, and one strand (the guide strand) is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC targets mRNA molecules complementary to the guide strand, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. In gene therapy, siRNAs can be delivered to cells to silence disease-causing genes, such as oncogenes or viral genes. In drug discovery, RNAi is used to identify and validate drug targets by knocking down specific genes and observing the phenotypic effects. High-throughput RNAi screens can identify genes essential for cell growth, survival, or disease progression, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets [PMID: 12183729].",

    "question": "How do cancer cells metastasize to distant organs, and what are the key steps involved in the metastatic cascade?",
    "answer": "Cancer metastasis involves a multi-step process: (1) Local invasion, where cancer cells degrade the extracellular matrix via proteases like MMPs, allowing them to penetrate surrounding tissues. (2) Intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood or lymphatic vessels. (3) Survival in circulation, where cancer cells evade immune surveillance and anoikis (detachment-induced cell death). (4) Extravasation, where cancer cells adhere to the endothelium and exit the vasculature. (5) Colonization, where cancer cells establish a new tumor microenvironment in the distant organ. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables cancer cells to acquire migratory and invasive properties, while the reverse process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), facilitates colonization at the distant site. Pre-metastatic niches, formed by factors secreted by the primary tumor, prepare the distant organ for metastasis [PMID: 21228864].",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system, and what are the mechanisms of viral persistence?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade host immunity. These include antigenic variation (mutations in viral surface proteins), latency (establishment of a quiescent state in host cells), interference with interferon signaling (blocking IFN production or signaling), inhibition of antigen presentation (downregulation of MHC molecules), and production of decoy molecules (soluble receptors that bind neutralizing antibodies). Viral persistence can be achieved through integration into the host genome (retroviruses), establishment of latent reservoirs in immune-privileged sites (herpesviruses), or chronic infection with continuous viral replication and immune exhaustion (HIV, hepatitis C virus). Understanding these evasion mechanisms is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies and vaccines [PMID: 17353966].",

    "question": "How do genetic mutations in the EGFR signaling pathway contribute to the development of lung cancer, and what are the targeted therapies available?",
    "answer": "Activating mutations in EGFR, such as exon 19 deletions or the L858R point mutation, drive lung cancer development by constitutively activating downstream signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. These mutations render cancer cells dependent on EGFR signaling, making them susceptible to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). First-generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib) reversibly bind to the ATP-binding site of EGFR, while second-generation TKIs (afatinib, dacomitinib) irreversibly bind to EGFR. Third-generation TKIs (osimertinib) are designed to target the T790M resistance mutation, which arises after treatment with first- or second-generation TKIs. Combination therapies targeting EGFR and downstream signaling pathways are being explored to overcome resistance and improve outcomes [PMID: 26658253].",

    "question": "How does the immune system distinguish between self and non-self antigens, and what mechanisms prevent autoimmunity?",
    "answer": "The immune system distinguishes self from non-self via central tolerance (elimination of self-reactive T and B cells in the thymus and bone marrow) and peripheral tolerance (mechanisms that suppress or inactivate self-reactive lymphocytes in the periphery). Central tolerance involves negative selection of T cells that strongly bind to self-antigens presented on MHC molecules in the thymus. Peripheral tolerance includes clonal deletion (apoptosis of self-reactive lymphocytes), clonal anergy (functional inactivation of self-reactive lymphocytes), regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress the activity of other T cells, and receptor editing in B cells (changing the specificity of the B cell receptor). Failure of these tolerance mechanisms leads to autoimmunity, where the immune system attacks self-antigens, resulting in chronic inflammation and tissue damage [PMID: 10690313].",
