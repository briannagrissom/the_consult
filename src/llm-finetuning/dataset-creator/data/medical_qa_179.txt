    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology facilitate the development of new therapeutics for inherited genetic disorders?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise modification of disease-causing genes in patient cells or model organisms. The Cas9 enzyme, guided by a synthetic guide RNA, creates a double-stranded break at a specific DNA sequence, which can then be repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to gene disruption, or homology-directed repair (HDR) if a template is provided, allowing precise gene correction or insertion. In therapeutic applications, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used ex vivo to modify patient cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells for sickle cell disease) or in vivo via viral vectors to directly target affected tissues (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy). The ability to precisely edit genes opens avenues for correcting the root cause of inherited diseases, offering potential curative therapies. Challenges include off-target effects, delivery limitations, and immune responses.",

    "question": "What are the established mechanisms by which metformin exerts its antihyperglycemic effects in patients with type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin's primary mechanism involves reducing hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, leading to downstream effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Metformin also enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle, improving glucose uptake and utilization. Additionally, it influences the gut microbiome, increasing the abundance of certain bacterial species that promote glucose homeostasis and reduce inflammation. While the exact molecular targets of metformin are still under investigation, its pleiotropic effects converge to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes [PMID: 28778128].",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity, and what are the main immune-related adverse events associated with their use?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, block inhibitory signals that prevent T-cell activation and proliferation. CTLA-4 blockade enhances T-cell priming in lymph nodes, while PD-1/PD-L1 blockade restores T-cell effector function within the tumor microenvironment. By unleashing T-cell activity, checkpoint inhibitors can induce durable anti-tumor responses in a subset of patients. However, this broad immune activation can also lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies (e.g., thyroiditis, hypophysitis), and skin toxicities. These irAEs arise from immune-mediated inflammation in various organs and require prompt recognition and management, often involving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants. The development of predictive biomarkers for irAEs is an area of active research to personalize treatment and minimize toxicity [PMID: 29101372].",

    "question": "What role do long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play in regulating gene expression and cellular function, and how are they implicated in disease pathogenesis?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein-coding potential. They regulate gene expression through diverse mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional processing. LncRNAs can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific genomic loci, or as decoys, sequestering transcription factors or microRNAs. They can also directly interact with DNA or RNA, influencing chromatin structure, splicing, and mRNA stability. Aberrant lncRNA expression or function has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. For example, the lncRNA HOTAIR promotes cancer metastasis by recruiting PRC2 to silence tumor suppressor genes, while MALAT1 regulates splicing and is upregulated in many cancers. LncRNAs represent a rich source of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers [PMID: 23791672].",

    "question": "How do emerging single-cell sequencing technologies advance our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and disease mechanisms in complex tissues?",
    "answer": "Single-cell sequencing technologies, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, allow for the comprehensive profiling of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and other molecular features at the individual cell level. This approach overcomes the limitations of bulk sequencing, which averages signals across heterogeneous cell populations, masking important cell-to-cell variations. Single-cell analysis can reveal novel cell subtypes, identify rare cell populations, and map cellular differentiation trajectories. In disease contexts, it can uncover altered cell states, identify disease-specific biomarkers, and elucidate the mechanisms driving cellular dysfunction. For example, in cancer research, scRNA-seq has been used to dissect the tumor microenvironment, identify drug-resistant cancer cells, and track the evolution of cancer clones. These insights are crucial for developing more targeted and effective therapies [PMID: 29634680].",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating host immunity and influencing susceptibility to autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a critical role in shaping host immunity. It influences the development and function of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Commensal bacteria produce metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), that promote immune homeostasis and suppress inflammation. They also compete with pathogenic bacteria for resources and produce antimicrobial compounds. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbial composition, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Specific bacterial species or microbial metabolites can trigger or exacerbate autoimmune responses by promoting intestinal permeability, activating autoreactive T cells, or inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Modulation of the gut microbiome through dietary interventions, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases [PMID: 28428829].",

    "question": "How does liquid biopsy facilitate personalized cancer treatment, and what are the primary types of biomarkers analyzed in liquid biopsies?",
    "answer": "Liquid biopsy, the analysis of tumor-derived material in bodily fluids such as blood, offers a non-invasive approach for monitoring cancer progression and tailoring treatment strategies. The primary biomarkers analyzed in liquid biopsies include circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and exosomes. CTCs provide information about the metastatic potential of the tumor and can be used for genomic profiling. CtDNA, fragments of DNA shed by tumor cells into the bloodstream, allows for the detection of specific mutations, monitoring of treatment response, and identification of resistance mechanisms. Exosomes, small vesicles secreted by tumor cells, contain proteins, RNAs, and DNA that can provide insights into tumor biology and intercellular communication. By analyzing these biomarkers, liquid biopsy can guide treatment decisions, such as selecting targeted therapies based on ctDNA mutations or monitoring response to immunotherapy by tracking changes in CTC counts. It also enables the early detection of disease recurrence and the identification of emerging resistance mechanisms, facilitating timely treatment adjustments [PMID: 26393454].",

    "question": "What are the primary mechanisms by which viruses evade host immune responses, and how do these mechanisms inform the development of new antiviral therapies?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade host immune responses, including interfering with interferon signaling, suppressing antigen presentation, and inducing immune cell apoptosis. Many viruses encode proteins that directly inhibit the production or signaling of type I interferons (IFNs), which are critical for antiviral immunity. For example, some viruses block the activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) or interfere with the IFN receptor signaling pathway. Other viruses downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules, preventing the presentation of viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Some viruses also encode proteins that induce apoptosis in immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Understanding these immune evasion mechanisms is crucial for developing new antiviral therapies. For example, therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing IFN signaling, restoring MHC class I expression, or blocking viral-induced apoptosis can improve antiviral immunity. Furthermore, the development of vaccines that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies and robust T-cell responses can overcome viral immune evasion mechanisms [PMID: 27323464].",

    "question": "How does the tumor microenvironment (TME) influence cancer progression and response to therapy, and what are the key cellular and molecular components of the TME?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem surrounding tumor cells that significantly influences cancer progression and response to therapy. The TME comprises various cellular and molecular components, including fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and soluble factors such as cytokines and growth factors. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth and metastasis by secreting growth factors, remodeling the ECM, and suppressing immune responses. Immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), can either promote or suppress tumor growth depending on their polarization state. Endothelial cells form blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to the tumor, and their dysregulation can contribute to angiogenesis and metastasis. The ECM provides structural support and signaling cues to tumor cells, and its remodeling can facilitate tumor invasion. Soluble factors, such as cytokines and growth factors, mediate communication between tumor cells and the TME, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Targeting the TME is an emerging strategy for cancer therapy, with approaches aimed at inhibiting angiogenesis, modulating immune cell activity, or disrupting ECM remodeling [PMID: 28301458].",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and how are these pathways being targeted for therapeutic intervention?",
    "answer": "Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and are associated with the dysregulation of several key signaling pathways. In AD, the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein triggers neuronal dysfunction and death. Key signaling pathways involved include the amyloidogenic pathway, tau phosphorylation pathways (GSK-3β, CDK5), and inflammatory pathways mediated by microglia and astrocytes. In PD, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies leads to dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. Major signaling pathways implicated in PD include the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction pathways (PINK1/Parkin), and inflammatory pathways. Therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways include inhibitors of beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase to reduce amyloid-beta production in AD, tau phosphorylation inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents. In PD, therapies are being developed to enhance autophagy, improve mitochondrial function, and reduce alpha-synuclein aggregation [PMID: 29030361].",
