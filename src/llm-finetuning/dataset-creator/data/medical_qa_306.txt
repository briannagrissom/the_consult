    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing work at the molecular level, and what are the primary challenges in its therapeutic application?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 employs a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a target DNA sequence, directing the Cas9 endonuclease to create a double-stranded break (DSB) at the specified site. The cell repairs this DSB either via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can disrupt the gene, or homology-directed repair (HDR) if a DNA template with the desired sequence is provided, allowing precise gene editing. Challenges in therapeutic application include off-target effects (cleavage at unintended sites), delivery to the correct cells or tissues, immune responses against Cas9, and mosaicism (incomplete editing across the target cell population). Improving specificity through modified Cas9 variants (e.g., high-fidelity Cas9) and optimized gRNA design, developing effective delivery vectors (e.g., adeno-associated viruses or lipid nanoparticles), and mitigating immunogenicity are key areas of ongoing research to enhance the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-based therapies.",

    "question": "Compare and contrast the mechanisms of action of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of type 2 diabetes.",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues by activating AMPK. SGLT2 inhibitors, on the other hand, block glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and a reduction in plasma glucose levels. While metformin does not typically cause hypoglycemia as monotherapy, SGLT2 inhibitors can increase the risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in certain individuals. Metformin's benefits extend to potential cardiovascular risk reduction, while SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated clear cardiovascular and renal benefits independent of glycemic control in several large clinical trials. They are often used in combination to target different pathways of glucose dysregulation in type 2 diabetes.",

  {
    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation influence gene expression in cancer cells, and what therapeutic strategies target these modifications?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands in promoter regions, generally represses gene transcription by recruiting methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs), leading to chromatin condensation. Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), relaxes chromatin structure and promotes gene transcription by neutralizing the positive charge of histones and facilitating the binding of transcription factors. In cancer cells, aberrant DNA methylation patterns (e.g., hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes) and altered histone acetylation profiles contribute to dysregulated gene expression and tumor development. Therapeutic strategies targeting these modifications include DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) like azacitidine and decitabine, which induce DNA demethylation and reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes, and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) like vorinostat and romidepsin, which increase histone acetylation and alter gene expression patterns. Combination therapies targeting both DNA methylation and histone acetylation are also being explored to enhance therapeutic efficacy.",

    "question": "Describe the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy.",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in shaping the host immune response and influencing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Specific bacterial species, such as *Akkermansia muciniphila* and certain *Firmicutes*, have been associated with improved responses to ICIs, while others, like *Bacteroides*, may correlate with resistance. These bacteria can modulate immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, enhance antigen presentation, and promote systemic T-cell activation. For example, *Akkermansia* has been shown to restore the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice by increasing the recruitment of CD4+ T cells to the tumor. The gut microbiome can also influence the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which can enhance T-cell function and promote anti-tumor immunity. Strategies to manipulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or dietary interventions, are being investigated to improve the efficacy of ICIs and overcome resistance mechanisms.",

    "question": "How do prions cause neurodegenerative diseases, and what are the key challenges in developing effective therapies?",
    "answer": "Prions, misfolded forms of the prion protein (PrPSc), induce conformational changes in normal prion proteins (PrPC) converting them into the pathogenic PrPSc isoform. This leads to aggregation, formation of amyloid plaques, and ultimately neuronal cell death. Prion diseases are characterized by long incubation periods and rapid progression once symptoms manifest. Developing effective therapies faces several challenges, including the difficulty of targeting PrPSc specifically without affecting PrPC, the limited understanding of the precise mechanisms of prion propagation and neurotoxicity, and the blood-brain barrier which hinders drug delivery to the central nervous system. Immunotherapeutic approaches, small molecules that stabilize PrPC or disrupt PrPSc aggregation, and gene therapies targeting PrP expression are under investigation, but effective treatments remain elusive.",

    "question": "Compare and contrast the mechanisms of action of reversible and irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in cancer therapy.",
    "answer": "Reversible TKIs bind to the ATP-binding pocket of tyrosine kinases in a non-covalent manner, allowing for competitive inhibition. Their binding is transient, and the kinase activity can be restored upon drug dissociation or increased ATP concentrations. Irreversible TKIs, on the other hand, form a covalent bond with the kinase, resulting in sustained inhibition even after the drug is removed. This can lead to more potent and durable target inhibition, but also potentially increased toxicity due to off-target effects. Irreversible TKIs may be particularly effective in overcoming resistance mutations that alter the ATP-binding pocket, making it difficult for reversible inhibitors to bind effectively. However, the irreversible nature of their binding also means that any off-target effects or toxicities may be prolonged. The choice between reversible and irreversible TKIs depends on the specific kinase target, the resistance mechanisms involved, and the desired therapeutic profile.",

    "question": "How do exosomes mediate intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment, and what is their role in cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes, nano-sized vesicles secreted by cells, mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, nucleic acids (mRNAs, miRNAs), and lipids between cells in the tumor microenvironment. They play a critical role in cancer metastasis by promoting angiogenesis, immune evasion, and pre-metastatic niche formation. Tumor-derived exosomes can deliver pro-angiogenic factors like VEGF to endothelial cells, stimulating blood vessel growth and facilitating tumor cell dissemination. They can also transfer immunosuppressive molecules like PD-L1 to immune cells, suppressing anti-tumor immunity and promoting immune evasion. Furthermore, exosomes can travel to distant sites and prepare the pre-metastatic niche by delivering specific cargo that alters the extracellular matrix, recruits immune cells, and promotes the survival and growth of arriving tumor cells. Targeting exosome biogenesis, secretion, or uptake represents a potential therapeutic strategy to disrupt intercellular communication and inhibit cancer metastasis.",

To overcome chemotherapy resistance, researchers are exploring several strategies, including developing novel drugs that are not substrates for ABC transporters, inhibiting ABC transporter activity with small molecules, targeting DNA repair pathways with PARP inhibitors, using pro-apoptotic agents to overcome resistance to cell death, and modulating the tumor microenvironment to enhance drug delivery and efficacy. Combination therapies that target multiple resistance mechanisms simultaneously, as well as personalized approaches based on the specific resistance profile of individual tumors, are also being investigated.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with CAR T-cells work, and what are the major toxicities associated with this treatment?",
    "answer": "CAR T-cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific antigen on tumor cells. These CAR T-cells are then infused back into the patient, where they bind to tumor cells, become activated, and kill the cancer cells. Major toxicities associated with CAR T-cell therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), characterized by fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress due to excessive cytokine production; immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which can manifest as confusion, seizures, and encephalopathy; and on-target, off-tumor toxicity, where CAR T-cells attack healthy cells expressing the target antigen. Management strategies for these toxicities include tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor antagonist) for CRS and corticosteroids for both CRS and ICANS. Ongoing research focuses on developing CAR T-cells with improved safety profiles and strategies to mitigate these toxicities.",

    "question": "Describe the role of exosomes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting exosome-mediated spread of amyloid-beta and tau.",
    "answer": "Exosomes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by facilitating the spread of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau aggregates between neurons. Exosomes can package and release Aβ oligomers and hyperphosphorylated tau, promoting their propagation and seeding in recipient cells. This exosome-mediated transfer contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, hallmarks of AD. Furthermore, exosomes can trigger inflammatory responses in microglia and astrocytes, exacerbating neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Potential therapeutic strategies targeting exosome-mediated spread of Aβ and tau include inhibiting exosome biogenesis or release using inhibitors of nSMase2 or GW4869, blocking exosome uptake by recipient cells using heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) inhibitors, and developing antibodies that specifically target exosomes carrying Aβ or tau, promoting their clearance or preventing their uptake by recipient cells. These strategies aim to disrupt the cell-to-cell transmission of pathological proteins and slow down the progression of AD.",
