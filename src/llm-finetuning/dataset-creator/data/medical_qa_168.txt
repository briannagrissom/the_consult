    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work at a molecular level, and what are the key challenges in its clinical application?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a target DNA sequence, directing the Cas9 endonuclease to that specific genomic location. Cas9 creates a double-stranded break, which the cell repairs via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), often introducing insertions or deletions that disrupt the gene, or homology-directed repair (HDR) if a template DNA is provided, allowing precise gene editing. Key challenges for clinical application include off-target effects, where Cas9 cleaves unintended sites due to sequence similarity; delivery limitations, as efficient and safe delivery methods to specific tissues are needed; and immune responses against Cas9, which can limit efficacy and raise safety concerns. Further research is focused on improving Cas9 specificity, developing novel delivery vectors like adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and exploring Cas9 variants with reduced immunogenicity to enhance the safety and effectiveness of CRISPR-based therapies.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and how can microbiome-targeted therapies be developed?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a significant role in IBD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and an imbalance in bacterial composition, disrupts the intestinal barrier, leading to increased permeability and immune activation. Specific bacterial species, such as adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) and certain pathobionts, can trigger or exacerbate inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals. Conversely, beneficial bacteria like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Microbiome-targeted therapies include dietary interventions (e.g., specific carbohydrate diets), prebiotics (to promote beneficial bacteria), probiotics (to introduce beneficial bacteria), antibiotics (to reduce harmful bacteria), and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to restore microbial diversity. Precision approaches involve identifying specific microbial signatures associated with disease activity and developing targeted therapies to modulate the microbiome composition and function, such as phage therapy or designer probiotics.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells develop resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in targeted therapy, and what strategies can overcome this resistance?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop TKI resistance through multiple mechanisms, including on-target mutations that prevent TKI binding, bypass signaling through alternative pathways, activation of downstream effectors, and phenotypic changes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). On-target mutations, such as EGFR T790M in lung cancer, directly impede TKI binding. Bypass signaling involves activation of parallel pathways like PI3K/AKT or MAPK, reducing dependence on the TKI-targeted pathway. Downstream effector activation circumvents the TKI-mediated blockade. EMT promotes drug efflux and increases cell survival. Strategies to overcome resistance include developing next-generation TKIs that target resistance mutations, combining TKIs with inhibitors of bypass pathways (e.g., PI3K or MEK inhibitors), using antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to deliver cytotoxic payloads, and employing immunotherapy to harness the immune system against resistant cells. Additionally, monitoring for resistance mechanisms through liquid biopsies can guide treatment decisions.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease, and how can they be targeted for therapeutic intervention?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves several key signaling pathways. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques activate inflammatory pathways, including microglia and astrocytes, leading to neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation disrupt microtubule function and axonal transport. Insulin signaling impairment exacerbates Aβ and tau pathology and impairs neuronal metabolism. Genetic risk factors like APOE4 modulate Aβ clearance and neuroinflammation. Therapeutic targets include inhibiting β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase to reduce Aβ production, enhancing Aβ clearance via immunotherapy, preventing tau phosphorylation with kinase inhibitors, modulating neuroinflammation with anti-inflammatory drugs or microglia modulators, and improving insulin signaling with insulin sensitizers. Combination therapies addressing multiple pathways are under investigation to achieve synergistic effects.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors work to enhance anti-tumor immunity, and what are the common immune-related adverse events?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, block inhibitory signals that normally dampen T-cell activation, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. PD-1 inhibitors block the interaction between PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells, preventing T-cell exhaustion. CTLA-4 inhibitors block CTLA-4 on T cells, preventing the inhibition of T-cell activation by B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies (e.g., thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency), and skin toxicities. Management of irAEs involves corticosteroids and, in severe cases, immunosuppressants like infliximab or mycophenolate mofetil. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential to minimize morbidity.",

    "question": "What are the main mechanisms through which epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, influence gene expression in cancer?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands, recruits methyl-binding proteins that condense chromatin and repress transcription. Histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), relaxes chromatin structure, promoting gene transcription. Histone deacetylation, catalyzed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), compacts chromatin and suppresses gene expression. In cancer, aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes, contribute to tumorigenesis. Alterations in histone modifications also play a role, with dysregulation of HATs and HDACs affecting cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Epigenetic drugs, like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and HDAC inhibitors, can reverse these aberrant modifications and restore normal gene expression patterns, offering therapeutic potential.",

    "question": "How do non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate gene expression and contribute to human diseases?",
    "answer": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in gene regulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ncRNAs (approximately 22 nucleotides) that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are longer than 200 nucleotides and regulate gene expression through diverse mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional processing. In human diseases, dysregulation of miRNAs and lncRNAs contributes to various pathological processes. For example, certain miRNAs can act as oncogenes by suppressing tumor suppressor genes, while others function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting oncogenes. LncRNAs can also promote or suppress tumorigenesis by modulating signaling pathways, affecting chromatin structure, or regulating mRNA stability. Targeting ncRNAs offers potential therapeutic strategies for various diseases.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms of action of metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and what are its potential long-term effects?",
    "answer": "Metformin's primary mechanism involves reducing hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis. It also enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, increasing glucose uptake and utilization. Additionally, metformin modestly reduces glucose absorption in the intestine and may have some effects on incretin hormones. On a molecular level, metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates energy homeostasis. Long-term effects include potential vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to anemia and neurological complications. Metformin is generally safe, but lactic acidosis is a rare but serious adverse effect, especially in patients with renal impairment. Studies have also suggested potential benefits in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and cancer.",

    "question": "How does the adaptive immune system respond to viral infections, and what are the roles of CD8+ T cells and neutralizing antibodies?",
    "answer": "The adaptive immune system responds to viral infections through cellular and humoral immunity. CD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), recognize viral antigens presented on MHC class I molecules of infected cells. Upon activation, CTLs kill infected cells, limiting viral spread. Neutralizing antibodies bind to viral proteins, preventing viral entry into host cells and facilitating viral clearance through opsonization and complement activation. B cells differentiate into plasma cells, which produce antibodies specific to viral antigens. The balance between CD8+ T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses varies depending on the virus and the stage of infection. Some viruses evade the immune system by mutating rapidly or suppressing immune cell function. Vaccines aim to induce both neutralizing antibodies and robust T cell responses to provide long-lasting protection.",

    "question": "How are liquid biopsies used in cancer management, and what types of biomarkers can be detected through this approach?",
    "answer": "Liquid biopsies involve analyzing bodily fluids (e.g., blood, urine) to detect cancer-related biomarkers. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be isolated and characterized, providing information about tumor heterogeneity and metastatic potential. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) consists of DNA fragments released by tumor cells into the bloodstream and can be analyzed for mutations, copy number alterations, and epigenetic modifications. Exosomes, small vesicles secreted by cells, contain proteins, RNAs, and DNA that reflect the tumor's molecular profile. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can also be detected in liquid biopsies and used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Liquid biopsies are used for early cancer detection, monitoring treatment response, identifying resistance mechanisms, and guiding personalized therapy decisions. Serial liquid biopsies can provide real-time information about tumor evolution and treatment effectiveness.",
