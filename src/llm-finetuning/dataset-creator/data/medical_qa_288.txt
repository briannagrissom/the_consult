    "question": "How does metformin exert its antihyperglycemic effects at the cellular and molecular level?",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, which increases the AMP/ATP ratio and activates AMPK. Activated AMPK then phosphorylates and inhibits key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase, thereby reducing glucose output from the liver. In addition, metformin increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, although the exact mechanisms are less clear. It may enhance insulin signaling by improving insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation and downstream activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Metformin also has effects on the gut microbiome, altering the composition and metabolic activity of gut bacteria, which may contribute to improved glucose homeostasis through increased production of short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites. Furthermore, metformin inhibits glucagon signaling and reduces intestinal glucose absorption, contributing to its overall antihyperglycemic effects. [PMID: 29635274]",

    "question": "What are the key differences between CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19 versus BCMA in the treatment of B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma, respectively, regarding mechanisms of action and clinical outcomes?",
    "answer": "CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19 and BCMA share the fundamental principle of engineering autologous T-cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific target antigen on cancer cells, triggering T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxicity. However, several key differences exist. CD19 CAR-T cells target a pan-B-cell marker expressed on nearly all B-cell lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, leading to broad B-cell depletion, including normal B-cells. BCMA CAR-T cells, on the other hand, target B-cell maturation antigen, which is primarily expressed on plasma cells and multiple myeloma cells. This results in a more selective depletion of malignant plasma cells while sparing early-stage B-cells. Clinically, CD19 CAR-T cells have demonstrated high rates of complete remission in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas and ALL, but long-term remissions are not always durable, and relapse can occur due to antigen loss or T-cell exhaustion. BCMA CAR-T cells have shown impressive response rates in heavily pretreated multiple myeloma, with deeper and more durable remissions compared to conventional therapies. However, challenges remain with BCMA CAR-T therapy, including the potential for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, and the emergence of BCMA-negative myeloma cells. Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment in myeloma can be immunosuppressive, limiting CAR-T cell persistence and efficacy. [PMID: 33424145]",

    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain contribute to resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?",
    "answer": "Mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain are a major mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC. The most common resistance mutation is T790M, which accounts for approximately 50-60% of cases. The T790M mutation increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP, making it more difficult for EGFR TKIs to bind and inhibit the kinase activity. In addition, other less common resistance mutations, such as C797S, L792H, and G796S, can also occur, often in combination with T790M or after treatment with third-generation EGFR TKIs. These mutations alter the binding pocket of EGFR, preventing EGFR TKIs from effectively binding and inhibiting the kinase. Furthermore, EGFR amplification and activation of bypass signaling pathways, such as MET amplification or activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, can also contribute to EGFR TKI resistance.

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, restore anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, restore anti-tumor immunity by blocking inhibitory signaling pathways that normally dampen T-cell activation and effector function. CTLA-4, expressed on T-cells, competes with CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), delivering an inhibitory signal that limits T-cell activation and proliferation. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies block this interaction, enhancing T-cell priming and activation in the lymph nodes. PD-1, also expressed on T-cells, binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are often upregulated on tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. This interaction delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell effector function and promotes T-cell exhaustion. Anti-PD-1 antibodies block this interaction, restoring T-cell activity and allowing them to effectively target and kill tumor cells. Furthermore, anti-PD-1 antibodies can reverse T-cell exhaustion and promote the expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies can synergistically enhance anti-tumor immunity by targeting different stages of the T-cell activation pathway. [PMID: 25519179]",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in modulating the efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Certain gut bacterial species can enhance anti-tumor immunity by stimulating the host's immune system and promoting the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila has been associated with improved responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients, likely through enhanced dendritic cell activation and T-cell priming. In contrast, other gut bacteria can suppress anti-tumor immunity by promoting the expansion of immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T-cells (Tregs), or by producing metabolites that inhibit T-cell function. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiome, has been linked to reduced responses to ICIs and increased risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as colitis. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or dietary interventions, are being investigated as potential approaches to enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of cancer immunotherapy.

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways that regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer, and how does EMT contribute to metastasis?",
    "answer": "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process by which epithelial cells lose their cell-cell adhesion and apical-basal polarity, and acquire mesenchymal characteristics, such as increased motility and invasiveness. EMT is regulated by several key signaling pathways, including TGF-β, Wnt, Notch, and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. TGF-β signaling induces EMT by activating Smad transcription factors, which promote the expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs), such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and ZEB1/2. These EMT-TFs repress the expression of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, and induce the expression of mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin and N-cadherin. Wnt signaling activates the β-catenin pathway, which also promotes the expression of EMT-TFs. Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions and can induce EMT in certain contexts. RTK signaling, such as EGFR and PDGFR signaling, can activate downstream pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which promote cell survival, proliferation, and EMT. EMT contributes to metastasis by enabling cancer cells to detach from the primary tumor, invade the surrounding stroma, intravasate into blood vessels, survive in the circulation, extravasate into distant organs, and colonize new sites.

    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work, and what are its potential applications in biomedical research and clinical therapy?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene editing technology that allows scientists to precisely modify DNA sequences in living cells. The system consists of two key components: the Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a molecular scissor, and a guide RNA (gRNA), which directs the Cas9 enzyme to the specific DNA sequence to be edited. The gRNA is a short RNA molecule that is complementary to the target DNA sequence. When the gRNA binds to the target DNA, the Cas9 enzyme makes a double-stranded break in the DNA at that location. The cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms then kick in to repair the break. There are two main pathways for DNA repair: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ is an error-prone pathway that often introduces insertions or deletions (indels) at the break site, disrupting the gene. HDR uses a template DNA sequence to repair the break, allowing for precise gene editing. CRISPR-Cas9 has a wide range of potential applications in biomedical research and clinical therapy, including gene knockout, gene correction, gene insertion, and gene regulation. It can be used to study gene function, develop new disease models, and create novel therapeutic strategies for genetic disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases. [PMID: 23287718]",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms of action of chemotherapeutic agents, such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and topoisomerase inhibitors, in killing cancer cells?",
    "answer": "Chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells through various mechanisms, broadly categorized by their targets and modes of action. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, introduce alkyl groups into DNA, causing DNA damage, cross-linking, and strand breaks, which disrupt DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death. Antimetabolites, such as methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil, interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis by mimicking natural metabolites required for nucleotide synthesis. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, a cofactor essential for purine and pyrimidine synthesis. 5-Fluorouracil is converted into metabolites that inhibit thymidylate synthase, blocking the synthesis of thymidine, a key component of DNA. Topoisomerase inhibitors, such as etoposide and irinotecan, interfere with the activity of topoisomerases, enzymes that regulate DNA topology during replication and transcription. Topoisomerase I inhibitors, like irinotecan, induce single-strand DNA breaks, while topoisomerase II inhibitors, like etoposide, induce double-strand DNA breaks. These breaks disrupt DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. [PMID: 11927524]",

    "question": "How does the Warburg effect, characterized by increased glycolysis in cancer cells, contribute to tumor growth and survival?",
    "answer": "The Warburg effect, or aerobic glycolysis, is a metabolic hallmark of cancer cells characterized by an increased rate of glucose uptake and glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. This seemingly inefficient metabolic pathway provides cancer cells with several advantages. First, glycolysis generates ATP more rapidly than oxidative phosphorylation, allowing cancer cells to meet their high energy demands for rapid proliferation. Second, glycolysis produces metabolic intermediates that can be used for biosynthesis, such as nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids, which are essential for cell growth and division. Third, glycolysis generates lactic acid, which is exported from the cell and acidifies the tumor microenvironment. This acidic microenvironment promotes tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, while also suppressing the anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, the Warburg effect can enhance resistance to apoptosis by increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. [PMID: 19133687]",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which viruses, such as HIV and influenza virus, evade the host immune system and establish persistent infections?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ a variety of strategies to evade the host immune system and establish persistent infections. HIV, for example, integrates its genome into the host cell DNA, allowing it to remain latent for long periods. HIV also exhibits high rates of mutation, generating antigenic variants that can escape antibody neutralization and T-cell recognition. Furthermore, HIV infects and depletes CD4+ T-cells, which are crucial for orchestrating the immune response. Influenza virus also undergoes rapid antigenic variation through a process called antigenic drift, which involves the accumulation of point mutations in the viral genes encoding surface proteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). These mutations allow the virus to evade antibody neutralization. Influenza virus can also undergo antigenic shift, which involves the reassortment of viral gene segments, leading to the emergence of novel viral strains with significantly altered HA and NA proteins. These novel strains can cause pandemics because the human population has little or no pre-existing immunity. In addition, both HIV and influenza virus can suppress the innate immune response by interfering with interferon signaling and other antiviral pathways. [PMID: 11581622]",
