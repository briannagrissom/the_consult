    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR signaling pathway lead to targeted therapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Mutations in EGFR, particularly activating mutations like exon 19 deletions or L858R, initially sensitize NSCLC to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, acquired resistance commonly emerges through several mechanisms. The most frequent is the T790M mutation in EGFR, which increases the receptor's affinity for ATP relative to the TKI, reducing drug binding [PMID: 16286926]. Other mechanisms include bypass signaling through MET amplification, HER2 amplification, or activation of PI3K/AKT pathways, diminishing dependence on EGFR signaling. Small cell lung cancer transformation can also occur. Additionally, downstream mutations in genes like BRAF or MEK can reactivate the MAPK pathway. Immunotherapy resistance can also arise in this context, possibly due to alterations in the tumor microenvironment. Combination strategies targeting multiple resistance mechanisms or immune checkpoint blockade are being explored to overcome these limitations.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome significantly influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Specific bacterial taxa, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved responses to ICIs in melanoma, lung cancer, and other malignancies [PMID: 29094886]. These bacteria can enhance anti-tumor immunity by modulating dendritic cell function, increasing T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and promoting the production of immunostimulatory cytokines like IL-12 and IFN-γ. Conversely, dysbiosis or the presence of certain other bacterial species can promote inflammation and suppress anti-tumor immunity, leading to reduced ICI efficacy. Mechanisms include the production of immunosuppressive metabolites or the activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Fecal microbiota transplantation studies in preclinical models and early clinical trials have demonstrated the potential to restore ICI sensitivity in patients with primary or acquired resistance. Dietary interventions and the use of prebiotics and probiotics are also being explored as strategies to optimize the gut microbiome and enhance the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy.",

    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology function, and what are its primary applications in biomedical research?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9) is a revolutionary gene-editing technology derived from the adaptive immune system of bacteria. It utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) molecule, complementary to a specific DNA sequence of interest, to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to that location in the genome [PMID: 22842260]. Cas9 then creates a double-stranded break in the DNA. The cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms then take over, either via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and often leads to gene disruption, or via homology-directed repair (HDR) if a DNA template with the desired sequence is provided, allowing for precise gene insertion or modification. In biomedical research, CRISPR-Cas9 is used extensively for gene knockout studies to understand gene function, for creating disease models in cell lines and animals, for developing gene therapies to correct disease-causing mutations, and for high-throughput screening to identify novel drug targets. It is also being explored in diagnostics and in agricultural biotechnology.",

    "question": "Compare and contrast the mechanisms of action of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, potentially by activating AMPK [PMID: 11228263]. It does not directly stimulate insulin secretion. SGLT2 inhibitors, on the other hand, block the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal renal tubule, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine and a reduction in blood glucose levels. SGLT2 inhibitors also have cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to reduced blood pressure, weight loss, and improved arterial stiffness. Both drugs are effective in lowering blood glucose, but they act through different mechanisms and have distinct side effect profiles. Metformin is associated with gastrointestinal side effects and, rarely, lactic acidosis, while SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of genital infections and, less commonly, diabetic ketoacidosis.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination, which is essential for accurately repairing double-strand DNA breaks [PMID: 8178825]. Mutations in these genes lead to impaired DNA repair capacity, resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability, which increases the risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers. Cells with BRCA1/2 mutations are more reliant on alternative DNA repair pathways, such as non-homologous end joining, which are error-prone and can lead to further mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. Furthermore, BRCA1/2 play roles in cell cycle control and transcriptional regulation. The lack of functional BRCA1/2 protein disrupts these processes, contributing to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. The sensitivity of BRCA1/2-mutated cancers to PARP inhibitors stems from their impaired ability to repair single-strand DNA breaks, which are then converted to double-strand breaks during replication, leading to cell death.",

    "question": "How do non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, regulate gene expression in cancer?",
    "answer": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ncRNAs (~22 nucleotides) that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression [PMID: 16103035]. They can function as oncogenes (oncomiRs) by downregulating tumor suppressor genes or as tumor suppressors by downregulating oncogenes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are longer ncRNAs (>200 nucleotides) with diverse mechanisms of action. They can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific DNA locations; as decoys, sequestering transcription factors or miRNAs; or as signals, recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes to alter gene expression. LncRNAs can regulate gene expression in cis (affecting nearby genes) or in trans (affecting distant genes). In cancer, lncRNAs can promote cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Both miRNAs and lncRNAs are promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers in cancer.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and how do they contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death?",
    "answer": "Several signaling pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation are central events. Aβ plaques activate inflammatory pathways involving microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of cytokines and chemokines that contribute to neuronal damage [PMID: 15652485]. Aβ also disrupts synaptic function and calcium homeostasis. Tau hyperphosphorylation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which disrupt microtubule function and axonal transport. The GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) pathway is a key regulator of tau phosphorylation, and its activation promotes tangle formation. Insulin signaling is also impaired in AD, leading to reduced glucose metabolism and increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, dysregulation of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), contributes to neuronal dysfunction and death. These pathways interact in complex ways, leading to synaptic loss, neuronal atrophy, and cognitive decline.",

    "question": "How does the tumor microenvironment influence the development of resistance to chemotherapy in solid tumors?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in mediating resistance to chemotherapy. Hypoxia within the TME induces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which promotes angiogenesis, cell survival, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), reducing drug sensitivity [PMID: 12882987]. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secrete growth factors and extracellular matrix components that protect tumor cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and limit drug penetration. Immune cells within the TME, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), can suppress anti-tumor immunity and promote tumor growth. Furthermore, metabolic adaptations within the TME, such as increased glycolysis and glutamine metabolism, can provide tumor cells with alternative energy sources and protect them from chemotherapy-induced metabolic stress. Targeting components of the TME, such as CAFs, TAMs, and hypoxia, is being explored as a strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance.",

    "question": "What are the main mechanisms by which viruses evade the host immune system to establish persistent infections?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade the host immune system and establish persistent infections. Some viruses, such as HIV, infect immune cells directly, crippling the host's ability to mount an effective response [PMID: 20889920]. Others, like herpesviruses, establish latency, residing in a quiescent state within host cells, avoiding detection by the immune system. Many viruses encode proteins that interfere with interferon signaling, a critical antiviral defense mechanism. Examples include NS1 of influenza virus and proteins encoded by hepatitis C virus. Antigenic variation, through mutation or recombination, allows viruses to escape antibody recognition. Downregulation of MHC class I expression, as seen with adenovirus, prevents cytotoxic T lymphocytes from recognizing and eliminating infected cells. Certain viruses also produce immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10, further dampening the immune response. The specific mechanisms employed vary depending on the virus and the host cell type.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, contribute to cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, are heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence itself. DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands, generally leads to gene silencing [PMID: 11753322]. In cancer, aberrant DNA methylation patterns are common, with hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, affect chromatin structure and accessibility, influencing gene transcription. Histone acetylation generally promotes gene expression, while histone methylation can either activate or repress gene transcription, depending on the specific histone residue and modification type. Dysregulation of histone-modifying enzymes is frequently observed in cancer, leading to altered gene expression patterns that contribute to cell proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Epigenetic modifications are reversible, making them attractive targets for cancer therapy. Drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs) are used in the treatment of certain cancers.",
