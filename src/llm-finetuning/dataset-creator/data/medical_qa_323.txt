    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome composition significantly modulates the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by influencing systemic immunity and tumor microenvironment. Specific bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved ICI efficacy in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer [PMID:30275479]. These bacteria can enhance dendritic cell activation, T-cell priming, and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes into tumors. Conversely, dysbiosis or the presence of other bacterial species can promote immune suppression and limit ICI response. Mechanisms include modulation of cytokine production (e.g., IL-12, IFN-γ, IL-10), alteration of gut permeability, and induction of regulatory T cells. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) studies have shown that transferring gut microbiota from ICI-responding patients to non-responding patients can improve clinical outcomes, providing causal evidence for the microbiome's role. Strategies to manipulate the gut microbiome, such as dietary interventions, probiotics, and FMT, are being explored to enhance ICI efficacy and overcome resistance.",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves a complex interplay of several key molecular mechanisms. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, formed by the aggregation of Aβ peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase, are a hallmark of AD. These plaques trigger neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction. Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, disrupt microtubule function and axonal transport, leading to neuronal death. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), increase Aβ production and early-onset AD risk. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is a major genetic risk factor, affecting Aβ clearance and aggregation. Other mechanisms include impaired glucose metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic neuroinflammation mediated by microglia and astrocytes, and disruption of calcium homeostasis. These processes synergistically contribute to neuronal loss and cognitive decline in AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and APOE4 are under investigation.",

    "question": "What is the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in cancer metastasis by modulating gene expression, chromatin remodeling, and signaling pathways. LncRNAs can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific DNA loci to regulate transcription. They can also function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), sponging microRNAs and thereby influencing the expression of microRNA target genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and invasion. For example, lncRNA MALAT1 promotes metastasis in various cancers by regulating EMT-related genes and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). LncRNAs can also modulate chromatin structure by interacting with chromatin-modifying complexes like PRC2 and LSD1, affecting the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and migration. Moreover, lncRNAs can influence signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, promoting cell survival and proliferation in distant metastatic sites. Therapeutic strategies targeting metastasis-associated lncRNAs are being explored to inhibit cancer dissemination.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR gene contribute to lung cancer development and treatment resistance?",
    "answer": "Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are common drivers of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activating mutations, such as deletions in exon 19 (del19) and the L858R point mutation in exon 21, increase EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. These mutations render tumors sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib. However, acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs frequently develops, often due to the T790M mutation in exon 20 of EGFR, which sterically hinders TKI binding. Other resistance mechanisms include MET amplification, bypass signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/AKT), and histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer. Third-generation EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib, are designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance. Combination therapies and strategies to target bypass pathways are being explored to further improve outcomes in EGFR-mutant lung cancer.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment?",
    "answer": "Exosomes, nano-sized vesicles secreted by cells, play a crucial role in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) carry a diverse cargo of proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA, DNA), and lipids that can be transferred to recipient cells, influencing their behavior. TDEs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. They can transfer oncogenic proteins and RNAs to neighboring tumor cells, enhancing their proliferation and survival. TDEs can also modulate the activity of stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Moreover, TDEs can suppress immune cell function by delivering immunosuppressive molecules to T cells and dendritic cells, facilitating immune evasion. TDEs can also prepare distant metastatic sites by delivering pro-metastatic factors to pre-metastatic niches. Targeting exosome biogenesis, secretion, or uptake is being explored as a therapeutic strategy to disrupt tumor-stroma interactions and inhibit cancer progression.",

    "question": "How does epigenetic modification contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. These modifications alter gene expression patterns without changing the DNA sequence, influencing immune cell development, differentiation, and function. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been observed in T cells and B cells from patients with autoimmune diseases, leading to altered expression of genes involved in immune regulation and inflammation. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, can also affect chromatin accessibility and gene transcription in immune cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate the expression of target genes involved in immune signaling pathways, contributing to autoimmunity. Environmental factors, such as infections and exposure to toxins, can induce epigenetic changes that promote autoimmune responses. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, are being explored as therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases by restoring normal gene expression patterns in immune cells.",

    "question": "What is the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in neurodegenerative diseases?",
    "answer": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs characterized by their covalently closed loop structure, are emerging as important regulators in neurodegenerative diseases. CircRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, sequestering miRNAs and preventing them from binding to their target mRNAs, thereby indirectly regulating gene expression. They can also interact with RNA-binding proteins, modulating their activity and localization. In Alzheimer's disease, some circRNAs have been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in amyloid-beta production and tau phosphorylation. In Parkinson's disease, circRNAs can influence the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and the function of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, circRNAs can regulate synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Dysregulation of circRNA expression has been observed in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that they may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Strategies to modulate circRNA expression or function are being explored as potential treatments for these diseases.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells exploit the Warburg effect to promote their growth and survival?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells often exhibit the Warburg effect, characterized by increased glucose uptake and glycolysis followed by lactate production, even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis). This metabolic shift provides cancer cells with several advantages. First, it allows for rapid ATP production, supporting the high energy demands of cell proliferation. Second, glycolytic intermediates are diverted into biosynthetic pathways, providing building blocks for nucleotide, amino acid, and lipid synthesis, which are essential for cell growth and division. Third, lactate production acidifies the tumor microenvironment, inhibiting the activity of immune cells and promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Fourth, the Warburg effect reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress, protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Cancer cells can upregulate glucose transporters (GLUTs) and glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), to enhance glycolysis. Targeting glycolytic enzymes or glucose transporters is being explored as a therapeutic strategy to disrupt cancer cell metabolism and inhibit tumor growth.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms by which viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse strategies to evade the host immune system, allowing them to establish persistent infections. These mechanisms include: (1) Interference with interferon (IFN) signaling: Many viruses encode proteins that inhibit IFN production or block the signaling pathways activated by IFNs, thereby suppressing antiviral responses. (2) Inhibition of antigen presentation: Viruses can interfere with the processing and presentation of viral antigens on MHC class I molecules, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). (3) Evasion of antibody responses: Viruses can rapidly mutate their surface antigens, generating antigenic variants that are not recognized by pre-existing antibodies (antigenic drift). They can also encode proteins that bind to antibodies, preventing their neutralization activity. (4) Suppression of immune cell function: Some viruses infect and kill immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages, leading to immunosuppression. Others encode proteins that suppress the activation or effector functions of immune cells. (5) Establishment of latency: Some viruses can establish a latent state, where they persist within host cells without actively replicating, making them invisible to the immune system. Understanding viral immune evasion mechanisms is crucial for developing effective vaccines and antiviral therapies.",

    "question": "How does dysregulation of autophagy contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases?",
    "answer": "Dysregulation of autophagy, a cellular process responsible for the degradation and recycling of damaged organelles and protein aggregates, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In healthy neurons, autophagy is essential for clearing misfolded proteins, such as amyloid-beta, tau, and alpha-synuclein, which can accumulate and form toxic aggregates in neurodegenerative conditions. Impaired autophagy leads to the accumulation of these aggregates, causing cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal death. Mutations in genes involved in autophagy, such as ATG5 and BECN1, have been linked to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, aging-related decline in autophagy contributes to the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles in the brain, promoting neurodegeneration. Strategies to enhance autophagy, such as treatment with autophagy-inducing drugs or genetic manipulation, are being explored as potential therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.",
