    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain lead to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) frequently arises through secondary mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, most commonly the T790M mutation. This mutation sterically hinders the binding of reversible EGFR TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib by increasing the affinity of EGFR for ATP. The T790M mutation stabilizes the inactive conformation of the EGFR kinase, shifting the equilibrium away from the active state required for drug binding and inhibition. Additionally, other resistance mechanisms include activation of bypass signaling pathways such as MET amplification, PI3K/AKT activation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which can circumvent EGFR inhibition. Newer generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib have been developed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by forming irreversible covalent bonds with EGFR, including the T790M mutant protein, thus restoring clinical sensitivity in a subset of patients. However, resistance to osimertinib can emerge through C797S mutations, highlighting the ongoing evolutionary adaptation of cancer cells to targeted therapies.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by influencing systemic immune responses and tumor microenvironment. Certain bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma and other cancers, potentially by enhancing T-cell infiltration into tumors and promoting dendritic cell maturation. Conversely, dysbiosis characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity and an enrichment of opportunistic pathogens can impair ICI efficacy. The underlying mechanisms involve the production of microbial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate and propionate, which modulate immune cell activity and cytokine production. SCFAs can enhance T-cell function and promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells, thereby influencing the balance between anti-tumor immunity and immune tolerance. Moreover, the gut microbiome can influence the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from ICI-responsive patients to ICI-refractory patients has shown promise in restoring sensitivity to immunotherapy, highlighting the therapeutic potential of microbiome manipulation in cancer treatment.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination. Mutations in these genes lead to impaired DNA repair, causing genomic instability and increased susceptibility to cancer development. Specifically, BRCA1/2 proteins are critical for repairing double-strand DNA breaks, which can arise from normal cellular processes or exposure to DNA-damaging agents. When BRCA1/2 are non-functional, cells rely on error-prone DNA repair pathways, leading to the accumulation of mutations that drive tumorigenesis. In breast and ovarian tissues, the loss of BRCA1/2 function increases the likelihood of uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, contributing to the development of cancer. Furthermore, BRCA1/2-deficient tumors exhibit a characteristic DNA repair deficiency, making them sensitive to PARP inhibitors, which block an alternative DNA repair pathway. This synthetic lethality principle is the basis for using PARP inhibitors in BRCA1/2-mutated cancers.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves several interconnected signaling pathways that contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death. The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques triggers a cascade of events, including tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic loss. Aβ plaques activate microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which exacerbate neuronal damage. Tau hyperphosphorylation results in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting microtubule function and axonal transport. Furthermore, impaired insulin signaling, mediated by insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and downstream kinases like PI3K/AKT, has been implicated in AD pathogenesis, contributing to Aβ accumulation and tau phosphorylation. Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction also play significant roles in AD. Targeting these signaling pathways with therapeutic interventions, such as anti-amyloid antibodies, tau aggregation inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents, is under investigation to slow down or prevent the progression of AD.",

    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis?",
    "answer": "Chronic inflammation plays a central role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by the formation of plaques in arterial walls. Endothelial dysfunction, triggered by factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking, leads to the expression of adhesion molecules like VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which recruit monocytes and T lymphocytes to the arterial intima. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which internalize modified LDL cholesterol, forming foam cells, a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions. Macrophages also release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, further amplifying the inflammatory response and promoting the recruitment of additional immune cells. T lymphocytes, particularly Th1 cells, secrete IFN-γ, which activates macrophages and promotes plaque instability. Chronic inflammation contributes to the breakdown of the extracellular matrix in the plaque, leading to plaque rupture and thrombus formation, which can result in acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Targeting inflammation with therapies such as statins and anti-inflammatory agents is an important strategy for preventing and treating atherosclerosis.",

    "question": "What is the role of epigenetic modifications in cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, play a critical role in cancer development and progression by altering gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, typically occurring at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs), can silence tumor suppressor genes, promoting uncontrolled cell growth. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, can alter chromatin structure, affecting the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and thereby influencing gene expression. For example, histone deacetylation is often associated with gene repression, while histone methylation can either activate or repress gene transcription depending on the specific histone residue modified. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), can regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA transcripts, leading to their degradation or translational repression. Aberrant epigenetic modifications can disrupt normal cellular processes, such as cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis, contributing to the development and progression of cancer. Epigenetic modifications are reversible, making them attractive targets for cancer therapy, with epigenetic drugs such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) showing promise in clinical trials.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system, and what are the key mechanisms involved?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse strategies to evade the host immune system, ensuring their survival and replication within the host. One common mechanism is the inhibition of interferon (IFN) signaling, a critical antiviral defense pathway. Viruses can encode proteins that interfere with the production or signaling of type I IFNs, such as IFN-α and IFN-β, which activate antiviral genes. Another strategy is the suppression of antigen presentation, which prevents the recognition of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Viruses can downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, reducing the presentation of viral antigens to CTLs. Additionally, viruses can produce proteins that mimic or interfere with the function of immune mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, disrupting the inflammatory response. Some viruses also establish latency, a state of dormancy within the host, where they remain undetectable by the immune system until reactivated by certain stimuli. Furthermore, viruses exhibit high mutation rates, allowing them to rapidly evolve and escape antibody recognition. Understanding these viral evasion mechanisms is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies and vaccines.",

    "question": "What role do exosomes play in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment?",
    "answer": "Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, play a crucial role in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor cells release exosomes containing a variety of biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA), and lipids, which can be taken up by recipient cells in the TME, such as stromal cells, immune cells, and other tumor cells. Exosomes can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. For example, tumor-derived exosomes can transfer oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to recipient cells, enhancing their proliferation and survival. Exosomes can also modulate the activity of immune cells in the TME, suppressing anti-tumor immunity and promoting tumor progression. They can deliver immunosuppressive molecules, such as PD-L1, to immune cells, inhibiting their cytotoxic activity. Additionally, exosomes can promote angiogenesis by delivering pro-angiogenic factors to endothelial cells, stimulating the formation of new blood vessels that supply nutrients to the tumor. Furthermore, exosomes can facilitate metastasis by delivering proteins and microRNAs that promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increase the migratory capacity of tumor cells. Targeting exosome biogenesis, release, or uptake could be a promising strategy for cancer therapy.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms of action of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents?",
    "answer": "Chemotherapeutic agents exert their cytotoxic effects through a variety of mechanisms that target essential cellular processes, particularly DNA replication and cell division. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, form covalent bonds with DNA, disrupting its structure and function, leading to cell death. Antimetabolites, such as methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil, interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis by mimicking or inhibiting the action of essential metabolites. Topoisomerase inhibitors, such as etoposide and irinotecan, block the activity of topoisomerases, enzymes that regulate DNA topology, resulting in DNA damage and cell death. Microtubule-targeting agents, such as paclitaxel and vincristine, disrupt microtubule dynamics, which are essential for cell division, leading to mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, intercalate into DNA, inhibit topoisomerase II, and generate free radicals, causing DNA damage and cell death. The choice of chemotherapeutic agent depends on the type of cancer, its stage, and the patient's overall health. Combination chemotherapy regimens often utilize agents with different mechanisms of action to maximize efficacy and minimize the development of resistance.",

    "question": "How can engineered T cells be used to target and eliminate cancer cells in adoptive cell therapy?",
    "answer": "Engineered T cells, particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and T-cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells, are used in adoptive cell therapy to target and eliminate cancer cells with high precision. CAR T cells are generated by genetically modifying a patient's T cells to express a synthetic receptor, called a CAR, which consists of an extracellular antigen-binding domain (typically derived from an antibody) fused to intracellular signaling domains that activate T-cell function upon antigen recognition. The CAR allows T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells expressing the target antigen, independent of MHC restriction. TCR-engineered T cells are generated by introducing a specific TCR gene into T cells, enabling them to recognize and kill cancer cells presenting the target antigen on MHC molecules. Upon binding to the target antigen on cancer cells, CAR T cells and TCR-engineered T cells become activated, releasing cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes, which induce apoptosis in cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating hematologic malignancies, such as B-cell lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, challenges remain in expanding the use of CAR T-cell therapy to solid tumors, including the identification of suitable target antigens and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.",
