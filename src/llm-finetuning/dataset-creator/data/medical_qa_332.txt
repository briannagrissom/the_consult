    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain lead to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC commonly arises through several mechanisms. The most frequent is the development of the EGFR T790M mutation, which sterically hinders the binding of reversible EGFR TKIs to the ATP-binding pocket. This mutation increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP, making it more competitive against the inhibitor. Other less common mechanisms include activation of bypass pathways such as MET amplification, HER2 amplification, or PI3K/AKT activation, which circumvent the need for EGFR signaling. Furthermore, phenotypic changes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and small cell lung cancer transformation can also lead to EGFR TKI resistance by altering cellular differentiation states and drug sensitivity profiles. Newer generation EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib, are designed to overcome the T790M resistance mutation by forming irreversible covalent bonds with EGFR, but resistance can still emerge through mutations such as C797S or through bypass signaling.",

    "question": "What role does the gut microbiome play in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome's role in autoimmune diseases is multifaceted and complex, involving both promoting and protective mechanisms. Dysbiosis, or imbalances in the gut microbial community, is frequently observed in autoimmune conditions. Specific bacterial species can trigger autoimmune responses through molecular mimicry, where microbial antigens share structural similarities with self-antigens, leading to cross-reactivity by autoreactive T and B cells. For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae has been implicated in ankylosing spondylitis due to shared epitopes with HLA-B27. The gut microbiome also influences immune cell development and function. Commensal bacteria promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which maintain immune tolerance and suppress autoimmunity. Conversely, certain bacteria can activate pro-inflammatory pathways, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to increased production of IL-1β and IL-18, which drive inflammation. Furthermore, the gut microbiome affects intestinal barrier integrity. Increased intestinal permeability, or 'leaky gut,' allows bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to enter the circulation, triggering systemic inflammation and potentially exacerbating autoimmune responses. Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being investigated as potential treatments for autoimmune diseases.",

    "question": "What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Aβ plaques are formed by the aggregation of Aβ peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), which are components of the γ-secretase complex, can increase Aβ production and aggregation, leading to early-onset familial AD. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules. Hyperphosphorylation of tau causes it to detach from microtubules and aggregate into insoluble filaments. The precise mechanisms linking Aβ and tau pathology are still being elucidated, but evidence suggests that Aβ oligomers can trigger tau hyperphosphorylation and spreading throughout the brain. Other factors implicated in AD pathogenesis include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired clearance of Aβ and tau. Genetic risk factors, such as the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), also contribute to AD risk by influencing Aβ clearance and neuroinflammation.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 function to enhance antitumor immunity?",
    "answer": "PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) and its ligand PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) are immune checkpoint molecules that regulate T-cell activity and prevent excessive immune responses. PD-1 is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and NK cells, while PD-L1 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells, as well as many cancer cells. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 delivers an inhibitory signal to T cells, suppressing their activation, proliferation, and effector functions. Cancer cells exploit this pathway to evade immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 expression, thereby inhibiting antitumor T-cell responses. Immunotherapies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 block this interaction, releasing the brakes on T cells and restoring their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies enhance T-cell activation, increase the production of cytotoxic cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote the infiltration of T cells into the tumor microenvironment. The efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade depends on the presence of pre-existing antitumor immunity, as well as the level of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. However, responses can also occur in patients with low PD-L1 expression, suggesting that other factors, such as tumor mutational burden and immune cell infiltration, also play a role.",

    "question": "What is the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play critical roles in gene regulation and cellular processes. LncRNAs are involved in various aspects of cancer development and progression, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance. LncRNAs can function as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific DNA loci to regulate gene transcription. For example, the lncRNA HOTAIR recruits PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) to silence tumor suppressor genes, promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. LncRNAs can also act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs) and preventing them from binding to their target mRNAs. This mechanism allows lncRNAs to indirectly upregulate the expression of oncogenes or downregulate the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, lncRNAs can regulate RNA splicing, stability, and translation, thereby influencing the expression of genes involved in cancer development. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been observed in various types of cancer, and some lncRNAs are being explored as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

    "question": "How does the adaptive immune system respond to viral infections?",
    "answer": "The adaptive immune system mounts a specific and long-lasting response to viral infections through the actions of T cells and B cells. Upon encountering viral antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, naive T cells become activated and differentiate into effector T cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), also known as CD8+ T cells, recognize viral antigens presented on MHC class I molecules and kill infected cells, eliminating the source of viral replication. Helper T cells, or CD4+ T cells, recognize viral antigens presented on MHC class II molecules and provide help to other immune cells. Th1 cells secrete cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, which activate macrophages and enhance CTL activity. Th2 cells secrete cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5, which promote B cell activation and antibody production. B cells differentiate into plasma cells, which produce antibodies that neutralize viruses, prevent viral entry into cells, and promote antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Memory T cells and memory B cells are generated during the adaptive immune response, providing long-term immunity to subsequent viral infections. These memory cells are rapidly activated upon re-exposure to the same virus, mounting a faster and more effective immune response.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, results from impaired insulin signaling in target tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Several signaling pathways contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Activation of serine/threonine kinases, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and IκB kinase (IKK), inhibits insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, which are essential for insulin signaling. JNK and IKK are activated by inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, as well as by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress. Activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) also contributes to insulin resistance by dephosphorylating IRS proteins. Increased levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide, lipid intermediates that accumulate in insulin-resistant tissues, activate protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, which inhibit insulin signaling. Furthermore, impaired mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative capacity contribute to insulin resistance by decreasing glucose disposal and increasing lipid accumulation. Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, also influence the risk of developing insulin resistance.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells acquire the ability to metastasize to distant organs?",
    "answer": "Cancer metastasis is a complex process involving multiple steps, including detachment from the primary tumor, invasion of the surrounding tissue, intravasation into blood or lymphatic vessels, survival in circulation, extravasation into distant organs, and colonization of the metastatic site. Cancer cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process characterized by loss of cell-cell adhesion and acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics, which enhances their migratory and invasive properties. EMT is driven by transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, and Twist, which repress the expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and promote the expression of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. Cancer cells secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and facilitate invasion of the surrounding tissue. Cancer cells also evade anoikis, a form of programmed cell death triggered by detachment from the ECM, allowing them to survive in circulation. The metastatic niche, or microenvironment of the distant organ, plays a crucial role in determining the success of metastasis. Cancer cells interact with stromal cells, immune cells, and ECM components in the metastatic niche, promoting angiogenesis, immune evasion, and colonization of the metastatic site.",

    "question": "How do genetic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes that play a critical role in DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination repair (HRR). Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 impair the ability of cells to repair double-strand DNA breaks accurately, leading to genomic instability and increased risk of cancer development. BRCA1 forms a complex with other proteins, including BRCA1-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1), which is involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint control. BRCA2 interacts with RAD51, a protein that facilitates strand invasion during HRR. When BRCA1 or BRCA2 is mutated, cells rely on alternative, error-prone DNA repair pathways, such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which can introduce mutations and contribute to genomic instability. Cells with BRCA1/2 mutations are particularly sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, such as platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors, which exploit their impaired DNA repair capacity. The increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer associated with BRCA1/2 mutations is likely due to the accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms of action of commonly used antidepressant medications, such as SSRIs and SNRIs?",
    "answer": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used antidepressant medications that work by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, the space between neurons. SSRIs selectively block the reuptake of serotonin by inhibiting the serotonin transporter (SERT), preventing serotonin from being transported back into the presynaptic neuron. This increases the amount of serotonin available to bind to postsynaptic receptors, enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission. SNRIs block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine by inhibiting both SERT and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). By blocking the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, SNRIs increase their levels in the synaptic cleft, enhancing both serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. The increased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine are thought to improve mood, reduce anxiety, and alleviate other symptoms of depression. However, the exact mechanisms by which these medications exert their antidepressant effects are still not fully understood. It is believed that long-term treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs leads to adaptive changes in the brain, such as changes in receptor sensitivity and neuroplasticity, which contribute to their therapeutic effects.",
