    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work at a molecular level?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a target DNA sequence, directing the Cas9 endonuclease to that specific location in the genome. Cas9 then creates a double-stranded break (DSB) in the DNA. The cell repairs this DSB through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and often results in insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt the gene, or homology-directed repair (HDR) if a donor DNA template with homology to the target site is provided, allowing for precise gene editing. HDR is less frequent than NHEJ. The specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 depends on the gRNA sequence and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirements. Off-target effects, where Cas9 cuts at unintended sites with similar sequences, are a major concern, and efforts are underway to improve specificity through modified Cas9 variants, truncated gRNAs, and computational prediction algorithms.",

    "question": "What are the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop chemoresistance through multiple mechanisms, including increased drug efflux via ABC transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein), altered drug metabolism (e.g., increased detoxification enzymes), mutations in drug targets, activation of DNA repair pathways, evasion of apoptosis (e.g., upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2), and alterations in cell cycle checkpoints. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can also contribute to chemoresistance by conferring stem-like properties and reducing drug uptake. Furthermore, changes in the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and increased extracellular matrix, can limit drug penetration and promote resistance. These mechanisms often coexist and interact, resulting in complex resistance phenotypes that require multi-faceted therapeutic strategies.",

    "question": "How do vaccines elicit long-term immunity against viral infections?",
    "answer": "Vaccines stimulate the adaptive immune system, leading to the generation of antigen-specific B and T cells. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibodies providing immediate protection and memory B cells that can rapidly produce antibodies upon re-exposure to the antigen. T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that kill infected cells and memory T cells that provide long-term surveillance. The longevity of vaccine-induced immunity depends on several factors, including the type of vaccine (live attenuated vaccines generally induce stronger and longer-lasting immunity than inactivated vaccines), the adjuvant used, and the individual's immune response. Germinal center reactions are crucial for generating high-affinity antibodies and long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. Periodic boosting may be necessary to maintain protective antibody levels over time, especially for vaccines targeting rapidly evolving viruses.",

    "question": "What is the role of the microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Dysbiosis, characterized by a reduction in microbial diversity and an imbalance in the composition of the gut microbiota, is commonly observed in IBD patients. Specifically, there is often a decrease in beneficial bacteria such as Firmicutes and an increase in potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli. This dysbiosis can lead to increased intestinal permeability, impaired barrier function, and heightened immune responses to microbial antigens. The altered microbiome can also produce metabolites that either promote or suppress inflammation. For example, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber, have anti-inflammatory effects and can be reduced in IBD. Conversely, microbial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can activate Toll-like receptors and exacerbate inflammation. The microbiome also interacts with the host's genetic background and immune system, influencing the development and severity of IBD. Strategies to modulate the microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being explored as potential therapies for IBD.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications influence gene expression in cancer?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in cancer. DNA methylation, typically occurring at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG islands), can lead to gene silencing. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is a common mechanism for their inactivation in cancer cells. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, alter chromatin structure and accessibility. Histone acetylation generally promotes gene transcription by relaxing chromatin, while histone methylation can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the specific histone residue modified. Aberrant patterns of histone modifications are frequently observed in cancer and can contribute to the dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can be targeted by epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), offering therapeutic potential for cancer treatment.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring various biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA), to recipient cells. They are formed through the endosomal pathway, where multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing exosomes into the extracellular space. Exosomes can be taken up by recipient cells through various mechanisms, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, direct fusion with the plasma membrane, or phagocytosis. Once inside the recipient cell, the exosomal cargo can alter gene expression, protein synthesis, and signaling pathways, influencing the cell's behavior and function. Exosomes play a role in diverse physiological processes, such as immune responses, angiogenesis, and tissue repair, as well as in pathological conditions, including cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases. They are also being explored as potential biomarkers and therapeutic delivery vehicles.",

  {
    "question": "How does immunotherapy harness the immune system to fight cancer?",
    "answer": "Immunotherapy leverages the patient's own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Strategies include checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) that block inhibitory signals on T cells, adoptive cell transfer (e.g., CAR-T cell therapy) that involves genetically engineering T cells to target specific cancer antigens, cancer vaccines that stimulate an immune response against tumor-associated antigens, and oncolytic viruses that selectively infect and lyse cancer cells while also triggering an immune response. Checkpoint inhibitors unleash pre-existing anti-tumor T cells by blocking immune checkpoints that normally prevent autoimmunity. CAR-T cell therapy involves collecting a patient's T cells, engineering them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific cancer antigen (e.g., CD19 in B-cell lymphomas), and then infusing the modified T cells back into the patient. Effective immunotherapy requires the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of targetable antigens on cancer cells. Biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) can help predict response to immunotherapy.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves several key signaling pathways. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing leads to the formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, triggering neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The tau protein, which stabilizes microtubules, becomes hyperphosphorylated, forming neurofibrillary tangles that disrupt neuronal transport. These processes are influenced by signaling pathways such as the GSK-3β pathway, which phosphorylates tau, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates cell survival and metabolism. Neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia and astrocytes, releases inflammatory cytokines that contribute to neuronal damage. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction further exacerbate neuronal injury. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2, affect Aβ production. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms also modulate AD risk, with ApoE4 increasing susceptibility. Therapies targeting these pathways, such as β-secretase inhibitors, γ-secretase inhibitors, and tau aggregation inhibitors, are under investigation, although clinical trial success has been limited.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved numerous strategies to evade the host immune system. They can interfere with interferon (IFN) signaling, a critical antiviral defense mechanism, by inhibiting IFN production, blocking IFN receptor signaling, or inhibiting the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Viruses can also downregulate MHC class I expression, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Some viruses encode proteins that directly inhibit complement activation or neutralize antibodies. Antigenic variation, through mutation or recombination, allows viruses to escape antibody recognition. Latency, where the virus remains dormant within host cells, allows the virus to evade immune detection. Viruses can also manipulate host cell apoptosis to prolong their replication cycle or inhibit apoptosis to prevent immune clearance. Furthermore, some viruses exploit immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) or producing cytokines that suppress immune responses. These evasion strategies contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis.",

    "question": "How do targeted therapies work in cancer treatment, and what are their limitations?",
    "answer": "Targeted therapies are drugs designed to specifically inhibit molecules or pathways that are essential for cancer cell growth and survival. They often target mutated genes or proteins that drive cancer development. Examples include EGFR inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer, BRAF inhibitors for melanoma, and BCR-ABL inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia. Targeted therapies can be highly effective in patients whose tumors harbor the specific target, leading to improved response rates and progression-free survival. However, their efficacy is limited by the development of resistance, which can occur through various mechanisms, including mutations in the target gene, activation of bypass pathways, or changes in the tumor microenvironment. Targeted therapies are also often associated with specific side effects related to the inhibition of the target molecule or pathway. Furthermore, not all cancers have well-defined targets, limiting the applicability of targeted therapies in some tumor types. Combination strategies and the development of new-generation inhibitors are being explored to overcome resistance and improve the efficacy of targeted therapies.",
