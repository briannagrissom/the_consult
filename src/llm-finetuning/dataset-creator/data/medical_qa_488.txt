    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain lead to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, such as exon 19 deletions or the L858R point mutation, sensitize non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like erlotinib and afatinib. However, most patients eventually develop acquired resistance, most commonly via the EGFR T790M mutation, which sterically hinders drug binding. The T790M mutation increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP, outcompeting the reversible inhibitors. Third-generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib were developed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by forming irreversible covalent bonds with EGFR, even in the presence of T790M. However, resistance to osimertinib can emerge through mechanisms such as EGFR C797S mutations (preventing covalent drug binding), MET amplification, bypass signaling activation (e.g., BRAF, PI3K/AKT), or histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer. Combinatorial strategies targeting bypass pathways or immune checkpoint blockade are being explored to address these resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, novel EGFR inhibitors and PROTACs are under development to degrade EGFR protein or target resistant EGFR mutants." ,

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in shaping systemic immunity and influencing the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Specific bacterial taxa, such as *Akkermansia muciniphila* and certain *Faecalibacterium* species, have been associated with improved ICI efficacy in melanoma, lung cancer, and other malignancies. These bacteria can enhance dendritic cell maturation, promote T-cell priming in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and increase the trafficking of cytotoxic T cells to the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, dysbiosis, often induced by antibiotic use, can impair ICI responses by reducing immune cell infiltration and promoting immune tolerance. Mechanistically, gut bacteria can synthesize metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate and propionate, which modulate immune cell function by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and altering gene expression. SCFAs can enhance T-cell activity, promote regulatory T-cell differentiation, and improve gut barrier integrity, reducing systemic inflammation. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or the use of prebiotics and probiotics, are being investigated as potential approaches to enhance ICI efficacy and overcome resistance." ,

    "question": "How does autophagy contribute to both tumor suppression and tumor promotion in different stages of cancer development?",
    "answer": "Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process, plays a complex and context-dependent role in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor in early stages and a tumor promoter in established tumors. In normal cells and early-stage tumors, autophagy functions as a tumor suppressor by removing damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and toxic aggregates, preventing cellular stress and genomic instability. By clearing damaged mitochondria, autophagy reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause DNA damage and promote tumorigenesis. Furthermore, autophagy can selectively degrade oncogenic proteins or activate tumor suppressor pathways, such as p53, thereby inhibiting tumor initiation. However, in established tumors, autophagy can promote tumor cell survival and growth under stressful conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and chemotherapy. Autophagy provides cancer cells with an alternative energy source by degrading intracellular components and recycling them into essential metabolites. It also protects cancer cells from apoptosis by removing damaged organelles and reducing cellular stress. Moreover, autophagy can facilitate metastasis by promoting cell detachment, migration, and invasion. The dual role of autophagy in cancer highlights the importance of considering the specific tumor context and stage of disease when developing autophagy-targeted therapies." ,

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire resistance to chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy through diverse mechanisms, including increased drug efflux, altered drug metabolism, target alterations, DNA repair enhancement, and apoptosis evasion. Increased expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and MRP1, mediates drug efflux, reducing intracellular drug concentrations. Altered drug metabolism, through increased detoxification or decreased activation of prodrugs, also contributes to resistance. Mutations in drug targets, such as topoisomerases or tubulin, can reduce drug binding affinity. Enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and homologous recombination (HR), allow cancer cells to repair chemotherapy-induced DNA damage more efficiently. Finally, cancer cells can evade apoptosis by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2) or downregulating pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax), reducing their sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced cell death. These mechanisms can occur individually or in combination, leading to multidrug resistance and treatment failure. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance, such as using ABC transporter inhibitors, developing drugs that bypass resistance mechanisms, or targeting DNA repair pathways." ,

    "question": "How do exosomes mediate intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment?",
    "answer": "Exosomes, nanoscale extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, play a critical role in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). They carry a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be transferred to recipient cells, altering their function and phenotype. Cancer cell-derived exosomes can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. For example, exosomes can deliver oncogenic proteins or miRNAs to neighboring cancer cells, enhancing their proliferation and survival. They can also transfer pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, to endothelial cells, stimulating new blood vessel formation. Exosomes can suppress immune cell activity by delivering immunosuppressive molecules, such as PD-L1 or TGF-β, to T cells and NK cells. Moreover, exosomes can facilitate metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells and preparing distant sites for tumor cell colonization. The composition and function of exosomes are highly context-dependent, varying depending on the cell type, tumor stage, and microenvironmental conditions. Targeting exosome biogenesis, secretion, or uptake is being explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to disrupt intercellular communication in the TME and inhibit tumor progression." ,

    "question": "How does epigenetic reprogramming contribute to cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic reprogramming, involving alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA expression, plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as global hypomethylation and promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, are frequently observed in cancer cells. Global hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability and activation of oncogenes, while promoter hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and RB, promoting uncontrolled cell growth. Histone modifications, including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Alterations in histone modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), can disrupt normal gene expression patterns, contributing to tumorigenesis. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Dysregulation of miRNA and lncRNA expression can affect various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can be targeted by epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and HDAC inhibitors, offering a promising approach for cancer therapy." ,

    "question": "How do mutations in the KRAS oncogene drive cancer development and therapeutic resistance?",
    "answer": "Mutations in the KRAS oncogene, particularly in codons 12, 13, and 61, are among the most common oncogenic drivers in human cancers, including lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. These mutations typically result in constitutive activation of the KRAS protein, a small GTPase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival signaling pathways. Activated KRAS continuously signals downstream effector pathways, such as the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. KRAS mutations also promote tumor angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. Historically, KRAS has been considered an \"undruggable\" target due to the lack of direct inhibitors. However, recent advances have led to the development of KRAS G12C inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, which specifically target the KRAS G12C mutant protein. These inhibitors have shown promising clinical activity in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC and other cancers. However, resistance to KRAS inhibitors can emerge through mechanisms such as bypass signaling activation, mutations in downstream effectors, or the development of alternative KRAS mutations. Combinatorial strategies targeting bypass pathways or immune checkpoint blockade are being explored to overcome these resistance mechanisms." ,

    "question": "What is the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cancer cell survival and drug resistance?",
    "answer": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response activated by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In cancer cells, the UPR is often constitutively activated due to high rates of protein synthesis, metabolic stress, and hypoxia. The UPR promotes cancer cell survival by increasing ER chaperone expression, enhancing protein folding capacity, and activating autophagy to remove misfolded proteins. The UPR also reduces protein synthesis to alleviate ER stress. However, if ER stress is prolonged or severe, the UPR can trigger apoptosis. Cancer cells can exploit the UPR to adapt to stressful conditions and develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Activation of the UPR can enhance DNA repair, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell cycle arrest, allowing cancer cells to survive cytotoxic stress. Targeting the UPR is being explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Inhibitors of UPR signaling pathways, such as IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6, are being developed to disrupt cancer cell adaptation to ER stress and induce apoptosis." ,

    "question": "How does immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 work to enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Immunotherapy targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 works by blocking the inhibitory interaction between PD-1, expressed on T cells, and PD-L1, which is often upregulated on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the tumor microenvironment. Under normal physiological conditions, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway serves as a crucial regulator of immune responses, preventing excessive T-cell activation and autoimmunity. However, in cancer, tumor cells exploit this pathway to evade immune surveillance. By expressing high levels of PD-L1, tumor cells can engage PD-1 on T cells, leading to T-cell exhaustion, reduced cytokine production, and impaired cytotoxic activity. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab, disrupt this inhibitory interaction, restoring T-cell function and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. These antibodies allow T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells more effectively. The efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors varies depending on the tumor type, PD-L1 expression levels, and the presence of pre-existing anti-tumor immunity. Biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) are used to predict response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors." ,

    "question": "How do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to tumor progression and metastasis?",
    "answer": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the tumor stroma, play a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis. CAFs are activated fibroblasts that exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics compared to normal fibroblasts. They can promote tumor growth by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components that support cancer cell proliferation and survival. CAFs also remodel the ECM, creating a permissive microenvironment for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. They secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the ECM, facilitating tumor cell migration. CAFs can promote angiogenesis by secreting pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF. Moreover, CAFs can suppress immune cell activity by secreting immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-10. CAFs can also enhance drug resistance by protecting cancer cells from chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Targeting CAFs is being explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to disrupt the tumor microenvironment and inhibit tumor progression. Strategies include depleting CAFs, inhibiting CAF activation, and reprogramming CAFs to a less tumor-promoting phenotype." ,
