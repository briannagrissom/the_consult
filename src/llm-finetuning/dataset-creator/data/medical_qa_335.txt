    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing work at a molecular level?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 leverages a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a specific DNA sequence to direct the Cas9 nuclease to that location in the genome. The Cas9 enzyme then induces a double-stranded break (DSB) at the targeted site. The cell attempts to repair this break through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and often results in insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt the gene, or homology-directed repair (HDR) if a DNA template with homologous sequences is provided, allowing for precise gene editing. The efficiency and specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 depend on factors such as gRNA design, Cas9 variant used, and delivery method. Off-target effects, where Cas9 cleaves unintended sites, remain a major concern, and various strategies like using high-fidelity Cas9 variants or modified gRNAs are being developed to minimize them. CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized gene editing due to its simplicity, versatility, and efficiency compared to earlier methods like zinc finger nucleases and TALENs.",

    "question": "How do circulating tumor cells (CTCs) contribute to metastasis?",
    "answer": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that have detached from the primary tumor and entered the bloodstream, representing a crucial step in the metastatic cascade. To successfully metastasize, CTCs must survive in the circulation, evade immune surveillance, adhere to and extravasate into distant tissues, and then colonize these sites. CTCs often undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances their migratory and invasive properties while reducing cell-cell adhesion. They also express surface markers that allow them to adhere to endothelial cells in the target organ. The tumor microenvironment at the distant site plays a critical role in determining whether CTCs can form a metastatic lesion. Pre-metastatic niches, established by factors secreted by the primary tumor, can attract and support CTC colonization. Furthermore, CTCs can travel in clusters, which have a higher metastatic potential compared to single CTCs. Detecting and characterizing CTCs can provide valuable prognostic and predictive information in cancer patients, and targeting CTCs is an area of active research for preventing metastasis.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome significantly influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by modulating systemic immunity and the tumor microenvironment. Specific bacterial species can enhance the response to ICIs, while others may promote resistance. For example, the presence of Akkermansia muciniphila has been associated with improved outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. The microbiome composition affects the maturation and activation of immune cells, such as dendritic cells and T cells, which are critical for anti-tumor immunity. Certain bacterial metabolites, like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can enhance T cell function and promote a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Conversely, dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiome, can impair the response to ICIs by promoting inflammation and suppressing T cell activity. Factors such as antibiotic use, diet, and underlying diseases can alter the gut microbiome and impact ICI efficacy. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being explored to improve the response to ICIs in cancer patients.",

    "question": "What is the mechanism of action of metformin in treating type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy metabolism. AMPK activation in the liver suppresses the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. Metformin also improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, such as muscle, by increasing glucose uptake and utilization. Additionally, it may have some effects on gut microbiota and incretin secretion, contributing to its overall glucose-lowering effect. Metformin does not typically cause hypoglycemia when used alone because it does not directly stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. It remains the first-line oral medication for type 2 diabetes due to its efficacy, safety, and low cost.",

    "question": "How do prions cause neurodegenerative diseases?",
    "answer": "Prions are misfolded forms of a normal cellular protein, PrP^C, that can self-propagate and induce other PrP^C molecules to misfold into the prion form, PrP^Sc. This process leads to the accumulation of PrP^Sc aggregates in the brain, which are highly resistant to degradation and can cause neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Prions propagate through a template-directed mechanism, where PrP^Sc acts as a seed that converts PrP^C into PrP^Sc. The aggregated prions form amyloid plaques, which disrupt neuronal function and trigger inflammatory responses. Prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), are characterized by rapid neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and motor dysfunction. The exact mechanisms by which prions cause neurotoxicity are still under investigation, but they likely involve disruption of cellular processes, oxidative stress, and activation of apoptotic pathways. There is no effective treatment for prion diseases, and they are invariably fatal.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with CAR T-cells work?",
    "answer": "CAR T-cell therapy involves genetically modifying a patient's own T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific antigen on cancer cells. The T cells are collected from the patient, engineered in the laboratory to express the CAR, and then infused back into the patient. The CAR allows the T cells to bind to the target antigen on cancer cells, leading to T cell activation, proliferation, and killing of the cancer cells. The CAR typically consists of an extracellular antigen-binding domain (often derived from an antibody), a transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains that activate the T cell. CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating certain hematologic malignancies, such as B-cell lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, it can also cause significant side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Strategies to mitigate these side effects include using CARs with lower affinity for the target antigen, incorporating safety switches into the CAR design, and managing the inflammatory response with medications.",

  {
    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy through multiple mechanisms, including increased drug efflux, altered drug metabolism, target alteration, DNA repair enhancement, apoptosis evasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Increased drug efflux is often mediated by overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein, which pumps chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell. Altered drug metabolism can involve increased detoxification or decreased activation of the drug. Target alterations, such as mutations in the drug target, can reduce drug binding and efficacy. Enhanced DNA repair mechanisms can allow cancer cells to repair DNA damage caused by chemotherapy, reducing its effectiveness. Evasion of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is another common mechanism of resistance. EMT can confer resistance by promoting cell survival and migration. These mechanisms can operate independently or in combination, leading to complex patterns of resistance. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance, such as using drug combinations, developing new drugs that target resistance mechanisms, and personalizing treatment based on the resistance profile of the tumor.",

    "question": "How does the tumor microenvironment (TME) influence cancer progression?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem surrounding cancer cells that significantly influences tumor growth, metastasis, and response to therapy. The TME comprises various cellular and non-cellular components, including fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and signaling molecules. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth by secreting growth factors and remodeling the ECM, creating a supportive environment for cancer cells. Immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, can either promote or inhibit tumor growth depending on their activation state and the cytokines they produce. Endothelial cells form new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to the tumor, supporting its growth and spread. The ECM provides structural support and influences cell signaling. Signaling molecules, such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, mediate communication between cancer cells and the TME, influencing tumor behavior. The TME can also protect cancer cells from immune attack and chemotherapy, contributing to treatment resistance. Targeting the TME is an area of active research for developing new cancer therapies.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade the host immune system, enabling them to establish persistent infections. One common mechanism is antigenic variation, where viruses mutate rapidly to alter their surface proteins, making them unrecognizable to antibodies generated against previous strains. Some viruses directly interfere with immune signaling pathways, such as blocking interferon production or inhibiting the activity of antiviral proteins. Others establish latency, where they remain dormant within host cells, avoiding immune detection. Viruses can also produce decoy molecules that bind to antibodies or complement proteins, neutralizing their activity. Some viruses infect and kill immune cells, such as HIV, which targets CD4+ T cells. Additionally, viruses can downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These evasion mechanisms allow viruses to persist in the host and cause chronic diseases.",

    "question": "How do non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression?",
    "answer": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play crucial roles in regulating gene expression at multiple levels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ncRNAs that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to translational repression or mRNA degradation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are longer transcripts that can regulate gene expression by interacting with DNA, RNA, or proteins. They can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific genomic locations; as decoys, sequestering transcription factors; or as signals, modulating signaling pathways. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules that can act as miRNA sponges, competing with endogenous targets for miRNA binding. They can also interact with RNA-binding proteins or even be translated into proteins. These diverse mechanisms of action allow ncRNAs to fine-tune gene expression in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and disease. Dysregulation of ncRNA expression has been implicated in many human diseases, making them potential therapeutic targets.",
