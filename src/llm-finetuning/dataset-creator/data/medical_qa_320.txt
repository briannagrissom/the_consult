    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR gene contribute to the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)?",
    "answer": "Activating mutations in EGFR, such as exon 19 deletions or the L858R point mutation, drive constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis in NSCLC. First-generation EGFR TKIs (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib) competitively inhibit ATP binding to the EGFR kinase domain, effectively blocking downstream signaling. However, acquired resistance frequently emerges, most commonly through the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20, which sterically hinders TKI binding. Third-generation TKIs like osimertinib were designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by forming irreversible covalent bonds with EGFR. Additional resistance mechanisms include bypass signaling through MET amplification or activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases, histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer, and downstream mutations in genes like BRAF or PIK3CA. Combination strategies targeting multiple resistance pathways are under active investigation.",

    "question": "What role do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, play in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, primarily at cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides, generally leads to transcriptional repression by recruiting methyl-binding domain proteins that compact chromatin and inhibit transcription factor access. Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), promotes a more open chromatin structure (euchromatin) and enhances gene transcription by neutralizing the positive charge of histones and facilitating the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Conversely, histone deacetylation, mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), restores the positive charge and leads to chromatin condensation and gene silencing. These epigenetic marks are dynamically regulated and play critical roles in cellular differentiation, development, and disease. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are frequently observed in cancer, where they can silence tumor suppressor genes or activate oncogenes, contributing to tumorigenesis and disease progression. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, are used to reverse these aberrant epigenetic marks and restore normal gene expression patterns in cancer cells.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms through which gut microbiota influence host immunity and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiota exerts a profound influence on host immunity through multiple mechanisms. Commensal bacteria prime the innate immune system by interacting with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells, promoting the production of cytokines and chemokines that shape immune responses. Gut microbiota also contribute to the development and maturation of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells. Certain bacterial species, such as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), promote the differentiation of Th17 cells, which play a role in host defense against extracellular pathogens but can also contribute to autoimmune inflammation. Other bacterial species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and promoting the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Dysbiosis, or alterations in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes. Specific bacterial species or microbial metabolites can trigger or exacerbate autoimmune responses by promoting inflammation, breaking immune tolerance, or mimicking self-antigens. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the gut microbiota, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or dietary interventions, are being explored as potential treatments for autoimmune diseases.",

    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development and progression of cancer, and what are the key signaling pathways involved?",
    "answer": "Chronic inflammation is a key driver of cancer development and progression, creating a permissive microenvironment that promotes tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. Inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, infiltrate the tumor microenvironment and release a variety of mediators, including cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β), chemokines, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), that can damage DNA, promote cell proliferation, and suppress antitumor immunity. Key signaling pathways involved in inflammation-associated cancer include NF-κB, STAT3, and MAPK pathways. NF-κB activation is a central event in inflammation and promotes the expression of genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. STAT3 activation is induced by various cytokines and growth factors and promotes cell survival, proliferation, and immune suppression. MAPK pathways, such as ERK and JNK, are activated by inflammatory stimuli and growth factors and regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Chronic inflammation can also lead to epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, that alter gene expression and contribute to tumorigenesis. Targeting inflammatory pathways and mediators is an active area of cancer research, with the goal of developing novel therapies that can prevent or treat inflammation-associated cancers.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms of action of checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, in cancer immunotherapy?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors unleash antitumor immunity by blocking inhibitory signaling pathways that normally dampen T cell activation. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) is expressed on T cells and competes with CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), delivering an inhibitory signal that limits T cell activation and proliferation. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies block this interaction, enhancing T cell priming and activation in the tumor microenvironment. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is expressed on T cells and binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are often upregulated on tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. PD-1 engagement delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T cell effector function, promotes T cell exhaustion, and induces T cell apoptosis. Anti-PD-1 antibodies block this interaction, restoring T cell activity and promoting tumor cell killing. Combination therapy with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies can further enhance antitumor immunity by targeting multiple inhibitory pathways, but is associated with increased toxicity. Checkpoint inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy in a variety of cancers, but not all patients respond, and predictive biomarkers are needed to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from these therapies.",

    "question": "How does the tumor microenvironment (TME) influence cancer metastasis, and what are the key components and interactions involved?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in cancer metastasis by providing a permissive environment that facilitates tumor cell invasion, intravasation, survival in the circulation, extravasation, and colonization at distant sites. The TME is composed of various cellular and non-cellular components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and soluble factors (e.g., cytokines, growth factors, chemokines). CAFs remodel the ECM, creating tracks that facilitate tumor cell migration and invasion. Immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), can promote tumor cell survival and immune evasion. Endothelial cells form new blood vessels that support tumor growth and provide routes for tumor cell dissemination. The ECM provides structural support and adhesion sites for tumor cells, but also contains growth factors and signaling molecules that can promote tumor cell survival and proliferation. Soluble factors secreted by tumor cells and stromal cells can modulate the TME and promote metastasis. For example, chemokines can recruit immune cells to the TME, while growth factors can stimulate angiogenesis. Interactions between tumor cells and the TME are complex and dynamic, and can vary depending on the cancer type and stage. Targeting the TME is an active area of cancer research, with the goal of developing novel therapies that can disrupt the metastatic cascade.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer progression?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm) secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by delivering proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA, DNA) to recipient cells. In cancer, exosomes play a crucial role in promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion. Tumor-derived exosomes can transfer oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to recipient cells, promoting cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Exosomes can also modulate the tumor microenvironment by delivering immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells, inhibiting their antitumor activity. For example, tumor-derived exosomes can transfer PD-L1 to T cells, suppressing their effector function. Exosomes can also promote metastasis by delivering matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to distant sites, facilitating ECM degradation and tumor cell invasion. Exosomes can also serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Liquid biopsies based on exosomal content are being developed to detect cancer-specific proteins and nucleic acids in blood or other bodily fluids. Therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting exosome secretion or uptake are being explored as potential cancer treatments.",

    "question": "What are the main molecular mechanisms through which viruses, such as HIV or influenza, evade host immune responses?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ a variety of strategies to evade host immune responses and establish persistent infections. HIV, for example, exhibits high genetic variability due to its error-prone reverse transcriptase, allowing it to rapidly mutate and escape antibody recognition. HIV also downregulates MHC class I expression on infected cells, reducing the presentation of viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift and antigenic shift, resulting in mutations in surface glycoproteins like hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) that allow them to evade antibody neutralization. Many viruses encode proteins that interfere with interferon (IFN) signaling, a critical antiviral defense mechanism. For example, some viruses encode proteins that block the activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) or inhibit the signaling pathways downstream of IFN receptors. Viruses can also induce the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β, which dampen immune responses. Furthermore, some viruses establish latency in specific cell types, where they are protected from immune surveillance. Understanding these immune evasion mechanisms is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies and vaccines.",

    "question": "What is the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene expression and cellular function, and how are they implicated in human diseases?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse class of RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play important roles in regulating gene expression and cellular function. LncRNAs can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific DNA loci; decoys, sequestering proteins away from their targets; or signals, recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes to specific genes. They regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including transcription, splicing, translation, and post-translational modification. LncRNAs are implicated in a wide range of cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and stress response. Dysregulation of lncRNAs has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. For example, the lncRNA HOTAIR promotes cancer metastasis by recruiting PRC2 to silence tumor suppressor genes. The lncRNA MALAT1 is upregulated in various cancers and promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. LncRNAs are also being explored as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for human diseases.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with CAR T-cells work, and what are its limitations and potential toxicities?",
    "answer": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's own T cells to express a CAR that recognizes a specific antigen on tumor cells. The CAR consists of an extracellular antigen-binding domain (typically derived from an antibody) linked to intracellular signaling domains that activate T cells upon antigen binding. CAR T-cells are generated by collecting T cells from the patient, genetically modifying them with a viral vector encoding the CAR, expanding the CAR T-cells in vitro, and then infusing them back into the patient. Once infused, CAR T-cells recognize and kill tumor cells expressing the target antigen. CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in hematologic malignancies, such as B-cell lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, CAR T-cell therapy is associated with significant toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome or ICANS), and on-target, off-tumor toxicity. CRS is caused by the release of large amounts of cytokines from activated CAR T-cells and can lead to fever, hypotension, hypoxia, and organ dysfunction. ICANS is a neurologic complication characterized by confusion, seizures, and encephalopathy. On-target, off-tumor toxicity occurs when the CAR T-cells recognize and kill normal cells expressing the target antigen. Furthermore, CAR T-cell therapy is expensive and requires specialized infrastructure and expertise.",
