    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain lead to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, particularly the T790M mutation, sterically hinder the binding of EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. The T790M mutation increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP, thus reducing the ability of EGFR inhibitors to compete for binding. Additionally, the C797S mutation can emerge after treatment with third-generation EGFR inhibitors (e.g., osimertinib), preventing covalent binding and restoring EGFR signaling. These mutations restore EGFR kinase activity, driving cell proliferation and survival despite ongoing EGFR inhibitor treatment. Other mechanisms, such as bypass signaling pathways (MET amplification, BRAF mutations) and histological transformation (small cell lung cancer), can also contribute to acquired resistance. Overcoming resistance often involves the use of newer-generation EGFR inhibitors that can bind to EGFR despite the presence of the T790M mutation or combination strategies targeting bypass pathways.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome significantly influences the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Specific bacterial taxa, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium spp., and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved responses to immunotherapy in melanoma and other cancers. These bacteria can enhance anti-tumor immunity by modulating dendritic cell function, promoting T-cell priming, and increasing the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes into the tumor microenvironment. The gut microbiome can also affect systemic inflammation and immune homeostasis, influencing the balance between immune activation and tolerance. Conversely, dysbiosis and antibiotic use can reduce the diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria, leading to impaired immune responses and decreased efficacy of immunotherapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and targeted interventions with probiotics or prebiotics are being explored as strategies to optimize the gut microbiome and enhance the therapeutic benefits of cancer immunotherapy. Further research is needed to identify specific bacterial signatures that predict response and to develop personalized microbiome-based approaches to improve patient outcomes.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves several interconnected signaling pathways that contribute to amyloid plaque formation, neurofibrillary tangle development, neuroinflammation, and neuronal dysfunction. The amyloid cascade hypothesis implicates the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing pathway, where aberrant cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase leads to the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Aβ oligomers trigger downstream signaling cascades, including activation of microglia and astrocytes, resulting in chronic neuroinflammation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. These cytokines activate the NF-κB pathway, further amplifying the inflammatory response and promoting neuronal damage. Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, mediated by kinases such as GSK-3β and CDK5, leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting microtubule stability and axonal transport. Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction also contribute to neuronal apoptosis and synaptic loss. Furthermore, impaired insulin signaling and reduced expression of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) exacerbate Aβ accumulation. Therapies targeting these pathways, including BACE1 inhibitors, tau aggregation inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents, are under investigation to slow or prevent the progression of AD.",

    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work, and what are its potential applications in treating genetic diseases?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9) is a revolutionary gene editing technology derived from the adaptive immune system of bacteria. It consists of two key components: the Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a molecular scissor, and a guide RNA (gRNA), which directs Cas9 to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The gRNA is a synthetic RNA molecule that contains a 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA site. Once the gRNA guides Cas9 to the target site, Cas9 creates a double-stranded break in the DNA. The cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms then kick in, either through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which can introduce insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt gene function, or through homology-directed repair (HDR), which allows for precise gene editing by providing a DNA template with the desired sequence. In the context of genetic diseases, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to correct disease-causing mutations, disrupt the expression of harmful genes, or insert therapeutic genes into specific locations in the genome. Potential applications include treating genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, sickle cell anemia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9-based therapies in various diseases.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms by which cancer cells metastasize to distant organs?",
    "answer": "Cancer metastasis is a complex, multistep process involving detachment from the primary tumor, invasion of surrounding tissues, intravasation into blood or lymphatic vessels, survival in circulation, extravasation at distant sites, and colonization to form secondary tumors. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process that enables cancer cells to lose cell-cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties. EMT is driven by transcription factors such as Snail, Twist, and ZEB1/2, which repress E-cadherin expression and promote the expression of mesenchymal markers like vimentin and N-cadherin. Cancer cells secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the extracellular matrix, facilitating invasion and migration. During intravasation, cancer cells enter blood or lymphatic vessels, where they must survive immune surveillance and shear stress. Some cancer cells form circulating tumor cell (CTC) clusters, which have enhanced metastatic potential compared to single CTCs. Extravasation involves adhesion to the endothelium at distant sites, followed by migration through the vessel wall into the surrounding tissue. Colonization requires cancer cells to adapt to the new microenvironment, establish angiogenesis, and evade immune destruction. The pre-metastatic niche, formed by factors secreted by the primary tumor, can prime distant organs for metastasis. Organotropism, or the preferential metastasis to specific organs, is influenced by interactions between cancer cells and the microenvironment at distant sites.",

    "question": "How does the immune system distinguish between self and non-self antigens, and what happens when this process fails?",
    "answer": "The immune system distinguishes between self and non-self antigens through a complex process involving both central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. Central tolerance occurs during lymphocyte development in the thymus (T cells) and bone marrow (B cells), where self-reactive lymphocytes are either deleted (negative selection) or rendered anergic (unresponsive). In the thymus, T cells that bind strongly to self-antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules undergo apoptosis, preventing them from attacking the body's own tissues. A similar process occurs in the bone marrow for B cells. Peripheral tolerance mechanisms operate outside the primary lymphoid organs and include clonal deletion, anergy, suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs), and receptor editing. Tregs suppress the activity of self-reactive lymphocytes, preventing autoimmunity. Receptor editing allows B cells to modify their antigen receptors to reduce self-reactivity. When these tolerance mechanisms fail, the immune system can mistakenly target self-antigens, leading to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes. Genetic factors, environmental triggers, and defects in immune regulation can all contribute to the breakdown of self-tolerance.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms of action of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol levels and reducing cardiovascular risk?",
    "answer": "Statins, also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, lower cholesterol levels primarily by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. By blocking cholesterol synthesis, statins reduce intracellular cholesterol levels in hepatocytes, leading to an upregulation of LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells. This increased expression of LDL receptors enhances the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, resulting in a decrease in circulating LDL cholesterol levels. Statins also reduce the production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which is a precursor to LDL. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering effects, statins have pleiotropic effects that contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction. These include improving endothelial function, reducing inflammation, stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques, and inhibiting platelet aggregation. Statins reduce inflammation by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). They also enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator that improves endothelial function. By stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques, statins reduce the risk of plaque rupture and thrombosis. These pleiotropic effects contribute to the overall cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy, independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects.",

    "question": "What are the key differences between innate and adaptive immunity, and how do they cooperate to protect against pathogens?",
    "answer": "Innate and adaptive immunity represent two distinct but interconnected branches of the immune system that work together to protect against pathogens. Innate immunity is the first line of defense, providing rapid but non-specific responses to a wide range of pathogens. It relies on pre-formed cellular and molecular components, such as macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, complement proteins, and antimicrobial peptides. Innate immune cells recognize pathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Activation of PRRs triggers inflammatory responses and the release of cytokines that recruit and activate other immune cells. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, is a slower but highly specific response that develops over time. It involves lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) that recognize specific antigens derived from pathogens. T cells mediate cell-mediated immunity, while B cells produce antibodies that neutralize pathogens or mark them for destruction. Adaptive immunity generates immunological memory, allowing for a faster and more effective response upon subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. The two branches of the immune system cooperate through various mechanisms. Innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells, act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that capture and process antigens and present them to T cells, initiating adaptive immune responses. Cytokines produced by innate immune cells can also influence the differentiation and activation of T cells and B cells. Antibodies produced by B cells can enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens by innate immune cells (opsonization) or activate the complement system, further amplifying the immune response.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways that regulate cell cycle progression, and how are they dysregulated in cancer?",
    "answer": "Cell cycle progression is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways that ensure proper DNA replication and chromosome segregation. Key regulators include cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their activating partners, cyclins. Different cyclin-CDK complexes control specific phases of the cell cycle: G1, S, G2, and M. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway plays a critical role in the G1 phase. Rb, when hypophosphorylated, binds to and inhibits E2F transcription factors, preventing the expression of genes required for cell cycle entry. Growth factors and mitogens activate signaling pathways, such as the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, that lead to the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes, releasing E2F and allowing cell cycle progression. The G1-S transition is also regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint, which is activated by DNA damage or replication stress. Activation of this checkpoint leads to the phosphorylation and activation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein that can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The G2-M transition is controlled by cyclin B-CDK1, also known as maturation-promoting factor (MPF). MPF activation requires the removal of inhibitory phosphates by the phosphatase CDC25. The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Dysregulation of these signaling pathways is a hallmark of cancer. Mutations in genes encoding cell cycle regulators, such as Rb, p53, and cyclin D, are frequently observed in cancer cells. Overexpression of cyclins, inactivation of CDK inhibitors, and loss of DNA damage checkpoints can all contribute to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system, and what are the strategies used to develop effective antiviral therapies?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to evade the host immune system, enabling them to establish persistent infections. These evasion strategies target various stages of the immune response, including interferon (IFN) production, antigen presentation, and T cell activation. Many viruses encode proteins that interfere with the IFN signaling pathway, blocking the induction of antiviral genes. Some viruses downregulate the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of infected cells, preventing the presentation of viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Others encode proteins that inhibit the function of natural killer (NK) cells, which are important for eliminating virus-infected cells. Viruses can also produce decoy molecules that bind to neutralizing antibodies or cytokines, preventing them from interacting with their intended targets. Some viruses establish latency, a state of dormancy in which the viral genome persists in the host cell without producing infectious particles, making them invisible to the immune system. Developing effective antiviral therapies requires a thorough understanding of viral replication cycles and immune evasion mechanisms. Antiviral drugs can target viral enzymes essential for replication, such as reverse transcriptase, protease, or integrase. Immunomodulatory therapies, such as IFN-alpha, can boost the host immune response to control viral infections. Vaccines can induce long-lasting protective immunity by stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies and CTLs. Emerging strategies include the use of monoclonal antibodies to neutralize viruses or target infected cells for destruction, and the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing to disrupt viral genomes.",
