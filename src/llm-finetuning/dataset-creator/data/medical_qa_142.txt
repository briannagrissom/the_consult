    "question": "How do mutations in the KRAS gene contribute to tumorigenesis, and what are the mechanisms of resistance to KRAS inhibitors?",
    "answer": "KRAS encodes a small GTPase that cycles between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) states, regulating downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT, which control cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Oncogenic KRAS mutations, commonly found in codons 12, 13, or 61, impair GTPase activity, resulting in constitutive activation of KRAS and sustained downstream signaling, driving uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Furthermore, mutant KRAS promotes resistance to apoptosis, induces angiogenesis, and enhances metastatic potential by modulating the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and migration. Mechanisms of resistance to KRAS inhibitors, such as sotorasib or adagrasib, include the emergence of secondary KRAS mutations that disrupt drug binding, activation of bypass signaling pathways (e.g., EGFR, HER2, or MET) that circumvent KRAS dependence, and the development of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which confers drug resistance and promotes metastasis. Additionally, activation of alternative RAS isoforms (e.g., HRAS or NRAS) or downstream effectors (e.g., BRAF or MEK) can restore MAPK signaling despite KRAS inhibition. Combination therapies targeting multiple signaling pathways or utilizing immunotherapy approaches are being investigated to overcome these resistance mechanisms and improve outcomes for patients with KRAS-mutant cancers.",

    "question": "What are the key differences between innate and adaptive immune responses in the context of viral infections, and how do they interact?",
    "answer": "Innate immunity provides an immediate, non-specific defense against viral infections through mechanisms such as physical barriers (e.g., skin and mucous membranes), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect viral components, and effector cells like natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages. PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), recognize viral nucleic acids and trigger the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which activate antiviral pathways and recruit immune cells to the site of infection. NK cells eliminate virus-infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules or expressing death ligands, while macrophages phagocytose viral particles and present viral antigens to T cells. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, is a delayed but highly specific response mediated by T and B lymphocytes. T cells recognize viral antigens presented on MHC molecules and differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that kill infected cells or helper T cells that secrete cytokines to activate other immune cells. B cells produce antibodies that neutralize viral particles, block viral entry into cells, or mark infected cells for destruction by complement or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Innate and adaptive immune responses interact in a complex and coordinated manner. Innate immune signals, such as IFNs and cytokines, activate and shape adaptive immune responses, while adaptive immune cells, such as T cells and antibodies, enhance innate immune functions and provide long-lasting immunity. For example, antibodies can opsonize viral particles for phagocytosis by macrophages, while T cell-derived cytokines can activate NK cells and macrophages to kill infected cells more effectively. Understanding the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity is crucial for developing effective vaccines and immunotherapies against viral infections.",

    "question": "How does epigenetic dysregulation contribute to the development and progression of cancer, and what are the therapeutic implications?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, thereby influencing cell fate, differentiation, and development. In cancer, epigenetic dysregulation can lead to aberrant activation of oncogenes or silencing of tumor suppressor genes, promoting uncontrolled cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis. DNA methylation, typically occurring at CpG islands in gene promoters, can silence tumor suppressor genes, such as p16INK4a or MLH1, leading to loss of cell cycle control or impaired DNA repair. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, can alter chromatin structure and gene accessibility, affecting the expression of genes involved in cell signaling, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, influencing various aspects of cancer biology. Therapeutic implications of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer include the development of epigenetic drugs that target DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs), which can reverse aberrant epigenetic modifications and restore normal gene expression patterns. For example, DNMT inhibitors, such as azacitidine and decitabine, are used to treat hematologic malignancies by demethylating and reactivating tumor suppressor genes. HDAC inhibitors, such as vorinostat and romidepsin, are used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma by altering histone acetylation and promoting cell differentiation and apoptosis. Combination therapies that combine epigenetic drugs with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy are being investigated to improve treatment outcomes and overcome drug resistance in cancer.",

    "question": "Compare and contrast the mechanisms of action of different classes of immunosuppressants used in organ transplantation.",
    "answer": "Immunosuppressants are essential for preventing organ rejection after transplantation by suppressing the recipient's immune system. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, are the cornerstone of immunosuppressive regimens. They inhibit T-cell activation by blocking the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which is required for the translocation of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) into the nucleus and subsequent transcription of IL-2, a key cytokine for T-cell proliferation and differentiation. mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus, inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. mTOR inhibitors block T-cell and B-cell proliferation by inhibiting the downstream signaling pathways of IL-2 and other growth factors. Antiproliferative agents, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), inhibit DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, affecting both T cells and B cells. Azathioprine is a purine analog that inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis, while MMF inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a key enzyme in guanine nucleotide synthesis. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents that inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, and suppress T-cell and B-cell activation. Biologic agents, such as monoclonal antibodies against CD3 (e.g., muromonab-CD3) or IL-2 receptor (e.g., basiliximab), selectively target and deplete or block the function of T cells. These different classes of immunosuppressants act through distinct mechanisms to suppress the immune system and prevent organ rejection, and they are often used in combination to achieve synergistic effects and minimize side effects.",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a significant role in modulating the host's immune system, metabolism, and response to cancer therapies. Certain gut bacteria can metabolize chemotherapeutic drugs, either activating them or inactivating them, thereby influencing their efficacy. For example, some bacteria can convert the prodrug capecitabine into its active form, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), while others can degrade 5-FU, reducing its cytotoxic effects. The gut microbiome can also modulate the host's immune response to chemotherapy by influencing the production of cytokines, chemokines, and immune cells. Certain bacteria can stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which can enhance the antitumor effects of chemotherapy, while others can suppress the immune response, leading to reduced efficacy. Furthermore, the gut microbiome can influence the toxicity of chemotherapy by altering the composition and function of the gut barrier. Chemotherapy-induced mucositis, a common side effect, can disrupt the gut barrier, leading to increased permeability and translocation of bacteria and bacterial products into the bloodstream, causing systemic inflammation and sepsis. Certain bacteria can protect the gut barrier by producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, which are important energy sources for colonocytes and promote gut barrier integrity. Modulation of the gut microbiome through dietary interventions, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is being investigated as a strategy to improve the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of cancer chemotherapy.",

    "question": "What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and how do they contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. Amyloid plaques are formed by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Aβ plaques disrupt neuronal function by inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Neurofibrillary tangles are formed by the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes neuronal cytoskeleton. Hyperphosphorylated tau disassociates from microtubules and aggregates into insoluble filaments, disrupting neuronal transport and leading to neuronal death. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), which are components of the γ-secretase complex, increase Aβ production and promote amyloid plaque formation. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD, increasing Aβ aggregation and reducing Aβ clearance. Other factors, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, also contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. These molecular mechanisms lead to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline, ultimately resulting in the clinical manifestations of AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms, such as Aβ-lowering therapies, tau inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents, are being developed to prevent or slow the progression of AD.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells evade immune surveillance, and what are the strategies to overcome these mechanisms?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells employ a variety of strategies to evade immune surveillance, allowing them to proliferate and metastasize unchecked. One key mechanism is the downregulation or loss of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are required for antigen presentation to T cells. Without MHC class I, cancer cells become invisible to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Cancer cells also express immunosuppressive molecules, such as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which binds to PD-1 receptor on T cells, inhibiting T-cell activation and function. Other immunosuppressive molecules include cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), which competes with CD28 for binding to B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), preventing T-cell activation, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which suppresses T-cell proliferation and differentiation. Cancer cells can also recruit immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), to the tumor microenvironment. These cells suppress antitumor immune responses by secreting immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β, and by depleting essential nutrients for T-cell activation, such as L-arginine. Strategies to overcome these immune evasion mechanisms include checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, which block the interaction between immunosuppressive molecules and their receptors, restoring T-cell function. Adoptive cell therapy, such as CAR-T cell therapy, involves engineering T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that recognize tumor-specific antigens, allowing them to directly kill cancer cells. Other strategies include oncolytic viruses, which selectively infect and lyse cancer cells, releasing tumor-associated antigens and stimulating an antitumor immune response, and cancer vaccines, which prime the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.",

    "question": "How do mutations in DNA repair genes contribute to cancer development, and what are the implications for targeted therapies?",
    "answer": "Mutations in DNA repair genes impair the ability of cells to repair DNA damage, leading to genomic instability and an increased risk of cancer development. DNA repair pathways, such as base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination repair (HRR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), are essential for maintaining genomic integrity. Mutations in these pathways can lead to the accumulation of DNA mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and microsatellite instability, which can drive tumorigenesis. For example, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are involved in HRR, increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Mutations in MMR genes, such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, lead to microsatellite instability and an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers. Implications for targeted therapies include the use of PARP inhibitors in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated cancers. PARP inhibitors block the repair of single-strand DNA breaks, leading to the accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks, which are normally repaired by HRR. In BRCA1/2-mutated cells, HRR is impaired, and the accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks leads to cell death. Another example is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with MMR-deficient cancers. MMR-deficient tumors have a high mutational burden and express neoantigens, which can be recognized by the immune system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block the interaction between immunosuppressive molecules and their receptors, restoring T-cell function and allowing the immune system to attack cancer cells. These examples highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair and their role in cancer development for the development of targeted therapies.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms by which viruses cause chronic infections, and how can these be targeted therapeutically?",
    "answer": "Viruses establish chronic infections through diverse strategies enabling them to persist within the host for extended periods. One common mechanism is immune evasion, achieved via rapid mutation rates (e.g., HIV, influenza), downregulation of MHC class I expression (adenoviruses), or direct inhibition of immune cell function (Epstein-Barr virus). Latency represents another key strategy, where the virus enters a quiescent state within host cells, avoiding immune detection (e.g., herpesviruses). These latent reservoirs can reactivate under certain conditions, leading to recurrent disease. Some viruses establish chronic infections by inducing immune tolerance or exhaustion, wherein the immune system becomes unresponsive to the virus (e.g., hepatitis B virus). This can involve the upregulation of inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4) on T cells or the expansion of regulatory T cells. Additionally, some viruses directly interfere with host cell apoptosis pathways, allowing infected cells to survive longer (adenoviruses). Therapeutic strategies to combat chronic viral infections focus on several areas. Antiviral drugs targeting viral replication are essential for managing viral load (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus). Immunotherapies aim to restore or enhance antiviral immune responses, including checkpoint inhibitors to reverse T cell exhaustion or therapeutic vaccines to boost cellular immunity. Strategies to eliminate latent reservoirs are also under development, such as \"shock and kill\" approaches that reactivate latent viruses to make them susceptible to antiviral drugs. Finally, gene editing technologies (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9) offer the potential to directly eliminate viral DNA from infected cells.",
