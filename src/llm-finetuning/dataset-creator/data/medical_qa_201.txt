    "question": "How do mutations in the KRAS gene influence downstream signaling pathways in cancer cells?",
    "answer": "Mutations in KRAS, particularly at codons 12, 13, and 61, render the protein constitutively active, bypassing upstream receptor signaling. This leads to persistent activation of downstream pathways including the MAPK/ERK pathway, promoting cell proliferation, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, enhancing cell survival and metabolism. Additionally, KRAS mutations can activate the RalGEF pathway, contributing to cytoskeletal rearrangements and metastasis. The specific impact varies depending on the mutation, tissue context, and other co-occurring mutations, leading to diverse oncogenic effects.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles secreted by cells that carry a diverse cargo of proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA), and lipids, enabling intercellular communication. Within the tumor microenvironment, exosomes facilitate bidirectional exchange between tumor cells, stromal cells (fibroblasts, immune cells), and endothelial cells. Tumor-derived exosomes can promote angiogenesis by delivering pro-angiogenic factors to endothelial cells, modulate immune responses by transferring immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells, and promote metastasis by preparing distant sites for tumor colonization. Stromal cell-derived exosomes, conversely, can influence tumor cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance. The specific effects depend on the exosomal cargo and the recipient cell type, making exosome-mediated communication a complex and dynamic process influencing tumor progression.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, regulate gene expression in human diseases?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, typically occurring at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs), is generally associated with gene silencing by recruiting methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs), leading to chromatin compaction. Histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), promotes gene transcription by relaxing chromatin structure and facilitating the recruitment of transcription factors. In disease, aberrant DNA methylation patterns (e.g., hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer) and histone modifications can disrupt normal gene expression programs, contributing to disease pathogenesis. These modifications are reversible and are thus potential therapeutic targets.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ a diverse array of strategies to evade host immunity, including: (1) antigenic variation through rapid mutation (e.g., influenza) or recombination (e.g., HIV), altering viral epitopes recognized by antibodies and T cells; (2) interference with interferon (IFN) signaling by blocking IFN production, receptor binding, or downstream signaling pathways; (3) inhibition of antigen presentation by downregulating MHC class I or interfering with peptide loading; (4) direct inactivation or killing of immune cells (e.g., HIV infecting CD4+ T cells); and (5) latency, establishing a persistent infection with limited viral gene expression to avoid immune detection. The specific mechanisms vary depending on the virus and host species.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 enhance antitumor immunity?",
    "answer": "PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, while its ligand, PD-L1, is often upregulated on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells within the tumor microenvironment. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector function, allowing tumors to evade immune destruction. Antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 block this interaction, relieving T-cell suppression and restoring antitumor immunity. This can lead to enhanced T-cell infiltration into tumors, increased production of cytotoxic cytokines, and improved tumor cell killing. However, not all patients respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and mechanisms of resistance include lack of T-cell infiltration, loss of MHC expression, and activation of alternative immune checkpoints.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Several signaling pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase leads to the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which aggregate into plaques and trigger neuroinflammation. Tau hyperphosphorylation results in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting microtubule function and neuronal transport. Furthermore, activation of the GSK-3β and CDK5 kinases contributes to tau phosphorylation. Chronic neuroinflammation activates microglia and astrocytes, releasing inflammatory mediators that exacerbate neuronal damage. Impaired insulin signaling and alterations in lipid metabolism also contribute to AD pathology. These interconnected pathways contribute to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline.",

    "question": "How do mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination. Mutations in these genes impair the cell's ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks, leading to genomic instability and an increased risk of cancer development. Cells with BRCA1/2 mutations accumulate DNA damage, which can activate oncogenes and inactivate other tumor suppressor genes, driving tumorigenesis. The increased risk is particularly pronounced for breast and ovarian cancer due to the role of these genes in maintaining genomic integrity in these tissues.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating host immunity and influencing disease susceptibility?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a critical role in shaping host immunity and influencing susceptibility to various diseases. Commensal bacteria contribute to the development and maturation of the immune system, promote intestinal barrier integrity, and compete with pathogens for nutrients and adhesion sites. Specific microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can modulate immune cell function and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiome composition, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disorders, metabolic syndrome, and even neurological conditions. The gut-brain axis enables bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, influencing mood, behavior, and neuroinflammation.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy through various mechanisms: (1) increased drug efflux via upregulation of ABC transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein); (2) alterations in drug metabolism or inactivation; (3) mutations in the drug target, reducing drug binding affinity; (4) activation of survival signaling pathways that bypass drug-induced apoptosis; (5) increased DNA repair capacity, mitigating drug-induced DNA damage; and (6) epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cell survival and metastasis. These mechanisms can be intrinsic or acquired during treatment, leading to decreased drug efficacy and disease progression.",

    "question": "What are the primary mechanisms by which gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, achieve targeted genome modification?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 achieves targeted genome modification through a two-component system: the Cas9 endonuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA, a synthetic RNA molecule, contains a 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA sequence. The gRNA directs the Cas9 protein to the specific genomic location. Cas9 then introduces a double-strand break (DSB) at the target site. The cell repairs this break via one of two main pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can lead to insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt gene function, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which uses a provided DNA template to precisely repair the break, allowing for gene insertion or correction. The efficiency and specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 editing depend on factors such as gRNA design, Cas9 variant, and delivery method.",
