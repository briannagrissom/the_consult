    "question": "How does epigenetic modification influence cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone acetylation/methylation, and non-coding RNA expression, play a critical role in cancer development by altering gene expression patterns without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation, particularly hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters, leads to transcriptional silencing and loss of function. Conversely, global hypomethylation can activate oncogenes and promote genomic instability. Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and accessibility, influencing gene transcription. For example, histone acetylation generally promotes gene expression, while histone methylation can either activate or repress transcription depending on the specific lysine residue modified and the enzymes involved. Dysregulation of histone-modifying enzymes is frequently observed in cancer. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are often dysregulated in cancer, contributing to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Epigenetic changes are reversible and can be targeted by epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (e.g., azacitidine) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat), which have shown clinical efficacy in certain cancers [PMID: 15761153].",

    "question": "Compare and contrast the mechanisms of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in treating depression.",
    "answer": "SSRIs selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) in the synaptic cleft, increasing serotonin neurotransmission. They bind to the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein, blocking the removal of serotonin from the synapse. SNRIs, on the other hand, inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) by binding to both SERT and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This dual action increases the levels of both neurotransmitters in the synapse. While both classes of drugs are effective antidepressants, SNRIs may be more beneficial for patients with comorbid pain conditions or those who have not responded to SSRIs. The side effect profiles of SSRIs and SNRIs can differ; SSRIs are more commonly associated with sexual dysfunction, while SNRIs may cause greater increases in blood pressure and heart rate due to their noradrenergic effects. The choice between an SSRI and an SNRI depends on individual patient factors, including symptom profile, comorbidities, and potential side effects. Some research suggests that the enhanced noradrenergic activity of SNRIs may provide greater efficacy in certain subtypes of depression characterized by significant fatigue, apathy, and impaired concentration [PMID: 16844351].",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a significant role in modulating the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Certain bacterial species, such as *Akkermansia muciniphila*, *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, and specific strains of *Bifidobacterium*, have been associated with improved responses to ICIs in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other solid tumors. These bacteria can enhance anti-tumor immunity by promoting the maturation and activation of dendritic cells, increasing the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor microenvironment, and modulating the balance of regulatory T cells. Conversely, dysbiosis, characterized by a reduction in microbial diversity and an overabundance of opportunistic pathogens, can impair ICI efficacy. Mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences ICI responses include the production of microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can modulate immune cell function. SCFAs like butyrate can enhance T-cell activity and promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells. The gut microbiome can also influence the expression of immune checkpoint molecules and the production of cytokines that regulate immune responses. Strategies to manipulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being explored to enhance ICI efficacy and overcome resistance [PMID: 29094884].",

    "question": "What are the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Aβ plaques are formed by the aggregation of Aβ peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Aβ oligomers are particularly neurotoxic, disrupting synaptic function and triggering inflammatory responses. NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules. In AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, leading to its detachment from microtubules and aggregation into NFTs. NFTs disrupt neuronal transport and contribute to neuronal loss. Neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a complex role in AD. Activated microglia can clear Aβ plaques and release neurotrophic factors, but chronic inflammation can also exacerbate neuronal damage. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, increase Aβ production and are associated with early-onset AD. The APOE4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, influencing Aβ clearance and aggregation. Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in AD, preceding neuronal loss. Aβ oligomers and tau aggregates impair synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, contributing to cognitive decline. Therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production, aggregation, and clearance, as well as tau phosphorylation and aggregation, are under development [PMID: 29376868].",

    "question": "Describe the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity.",
    "answer": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of T lymphocytes that play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. Tregs suppress the activity of other immune cells, including effector T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells, thereby preventing excessive immune responses that can lead to tissue damage and autoimmune diseases. The transcription factor Foxp3 is the master regulator of Treg development and function. Tregs can suppress immune responses through multiple mechanisms, including the production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, the expression of inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, and the consumption of IL-2, a cytokine required for T-cell proliferation and survival. Tregs also interact with dendritic cells (DCs), inhibiting their maturation and antigen-presenting capacity. Dysfunctional or deficient Tregs can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Conversely, enhancing Treg function can be a therapeutic strategy for treating autoimmune diseases and preventing transplant rejection. Strategies to expand or enhance Treg function include the administration of low-dose IL-2, the use of CTLA-4 agonists, and the adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded Tregs [PMID: 28346441].",

    "question": "How do circulating tumor cells (CTCs) contribute to cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that have detached from the primary tumor and entered the bloodstream, representing an intermediate step in the metastatic cascade. CTCs can contribute to cancer metastasis through several mechanisms. First, CTCs must survive in the hostile environment of the bloodstream, which requires them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that confers increased motility, invasiveness, and resistance to anoikis (detachment-induced cell death). CTCs can also aggregate with other CTCs or with platelets to form CTC clusters, which have a higher metastatic potential than single CTCs. CTC clusters can adhere to the endothelium of distant organs and extravasate into the surrounding tissue, where they can initiate the formation of new metastatic lesions. The ability of CTCs to colonize distant organs depends on the tumor microenvironment at the metastatic site, which can provide growth factors, cytokines, and other signals that support tumor cell survival and proliferation. CTCs can also seed pre-metastatic niches, which are microenvironments that have been conditioned by factors secreted by the primary tumor to promote metastasis. CTC enumeration and characterization are being used as biomarkers for cancer prognosis and treatment response [PMID: 22426664].",

    "question": "Compare and contrast the mechanisms of action of metformin and sulfonylureas in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",
    "answer": "Metformin is a biguanide that primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor that inhibits gluconeogenesis and increases glucose uptake. Metformin does not directly stimulate insulin secretion and has a low risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. Sulfonylureas, on the other hand, stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) on the beta-cell membrane, which closes ATP-sensitive potassium channels and depolarizes the cell, leading to calcium influx and insulin release. Sulfonylureas can cause hypoglycemia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function or those who skip meals. While both metformin and sulfonylureas are effective in lowering blood glucose levels, metformin is generally preferred as first-line therapy due to its lower risk of hypoglycemia and potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. Sulfonylureas may be used in combination with metformin or other agents when additional glycemic control is needed [PMID: 29268105].",

    "question": "How do cancer cells evade immune surveillance mediated by natural killer (NK) cells?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells employ multiple mechanisms to evade immune surveillance by natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells recognize and kill target cells based on the balance of activating and inhibitory signals received through various cell surface receptors. Cancer cells can downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules, which are ligands for inhibitory receptors on NK cells, thereby reducing inhibitory signaling and potentially making them more susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing. However, cancer cells can also upregulate the expression of ligands for activating receptors on NK cells, such as NKG2D ligands (e.g., MICA, MICB, ULBP) and DNAM-1 ligands (e.g., PVR, Nectin-2), which can trigger NK cell activation and cytotoxicity. To counteract this, cancer cells can shed soluble forms of NKG2D ligands, which bind to and downregulate NKG2D receptors on NK cells, impairing their ability to recognize and kill target cells. Cancer cells can also secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-10, which inhibit NK cell function. Furthermore, cancer cells can express checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, which engage with PD-1 on NK cells and inhibit their activity. Finally, cancer cells can recruit immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which can suppress NK cell function and promote immune evasion [PMID: 25609885].",

    "question": "Describe the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis.",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) that are secreted by cells and mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA) to recipient cells. In cancer, exosomes play a significant role in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. Cancer cells secrete exosomes that can deliver oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to recipient cells, promoting their proliferation and survival. Exosomes can also stimulate angiogenesis by delivering pro-angiogenic factors to endothelial cells, promoting the formation of new blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. Exosomes can suppress immune responses by delivering immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells, such as T cells and NK cells, impairing their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. Exosomes can also promote metastasis by delivering matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to the extracellular matrix, facilitating tumor cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, exosomes can transport cancer-associated antigens to distant sites, preparing the microenvironment for metastasis. Exosomes are being explored as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment [PMID: 26681336].",

    "question": "How does gene therapy work, and what are some of the challenges associated with its clinical application?",
    "answer": "Gene therapy involves introducing genetic material into cells to treat or prevent disease. There are two main approaches: *ex vivo* and *in vivo* gene therapy. In *ex vivo* gene therapy, cells are removed from the patient, genetically modified in the laboratory, and then transplanted back into the patient. In *in vivo* gene therapy, the genetic material is delivered directly to cells within the patient's body. Viral vectors, such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus, are commonly used to deliver genes into cells. Gene therapy can be used to replace a mutated gene with a functional copy, inactivate a mutated gene that is functioning improperly, or introduce a new gene to help fight disease. Challenges associated with gene therapy include: *Immune response*: The body's immune system may recognize the viral vector or the introduced gene as foreign and mount an immune response, which can lead to inflammation and damage to the treated cells. *Off-target effects*: The viral vector may insert the gene into the wrong location in the genome, which can disrupt the function of other genes and potentially lead to cancer. *Limited duration of expression*: The introduced gene may not be expressed for a long period of time, requiring repeated treatments. *Delivery efficiency*: It can be difficult to deliver the gene to the target cells with high efficiency. Despite these challenges, gene therapy has shown promising results in treating a number of genetic diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia, and severe combined immunodeficiency [PMID: 31786660].",
