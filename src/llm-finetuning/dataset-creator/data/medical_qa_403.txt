    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, such as L858R and exon 19 deletions, sensitize non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like gefitinib and erlotinib. However, acquired resistance invariably develops, with the most common mechanism being the T790M mutation, which sterically hinders TKI binding. This mutation increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP, outcompeting the reversible inhibitors. Additionally, T790M stabilizes EGFR in an active conformation even in the absence of ligand, leading to continued downstream signaling. Other less frequent resistance mechanisms include MET amplification, bypass signaling through HER2 or HER3, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and transformation to small cell lung cancer. Third-generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib were developed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance, but acquired resistance to osimertinib can arise through C797S mutations or bypass signaling pathways. Therefore, understanding the specific resistance mechanisms is crucial for selecting the appropriate treatment strategy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.",

    "question": "What are the roles of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiota plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), influencing both disease initiation and progression. Dysbiosis, characterized by decreased microbial diversity and altered composition, is a hallmark of IBD. Specific bacterial species, such as adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) and certain pathobionts, can exacerbate inflammation by disrupting the intestinal epithelial barrier, activating the innate immune system via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and promoting Th1 and Th17 cell responses. Conversely, commensal bacteria like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii produce anti-inflammatory metabolites such as butyrate, which strengthens the epithelial barrier, suppresses NF-κB signaling, and promotes regulatory T-cell development. Genetic factors, environmental triggers, and immune dysregulation interact with the gut microbiota to drive chronic inflammation in IBD. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and targeted dietary interventions are being explored as therapeutic strategies to restore microbial balance and modulate the host immune response in IBD patients.",

    "question": "How does the Warburg effect contribute to tumor growth and metastasis?",
    "answer": "The Warburg effect, or aerobic glycolysis, is a metabolic adaptation observed in cancer cells characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate production even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift provides several advantages for tumor growth and metastasis. First, it generates ATP and biosynthetic precursors more rapidly than oxidative phosphorylation, supporting the high proliferation rate of cancer cells. Second, the acidic microenvironment resulting from lactate secretion promotes extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. Third, the Warburg effect enhances cancer cell survival under hypoxic conditions and contributes to chemoresistance by reducing mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, the altered metabolic state influences epigenetic modifications and signaling pathways, promoting tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. Targeting the Warburg effect through glycolysis inhibitors or by modulating mitochondrial function is being investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms of action of metformin in treating type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin, a first-line drug for type 2 diabetes, primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis. This effect is mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor. AMPK activation suppresses the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes and improves insulin sensitivity. Metformin also enhances glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle, and reduces intestinal glucose absorption. Furthermore, metformin modulates the gut microbiota composition, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria that improve glucose metabolism. While the exact molecular mechanisms of metformin action are still being investigated, its multi-faceted effects contribute to its efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels and improving metabolic control in type 2 diabetes patients.",

    "question": "How do prions cause neurodegenerative diseases?",
    "answer": "Prions are misfolded proteins that can self-propagate and induce conformational changes in normally folded proteins, leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The prion protein (PrP) exists in a normal cellular form (PrPC) and a misfolded, infectious form (PrPSc). PrPSc acts as a template, converting PrPC into PrPSc, which then aggregates to form amyloid plaques in the brain. These aggregates disrupt neuronal function, trigger apoptosis, and activate microglia, leading to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive neurodegeneration. The prion replication process is highly resistant to conventional sterilization methods, making prion diseases difficult to treat and prevent. Understanding the mechanisms of prion propagation and neurotoxicity is crucial for developing effective therapies to combat these devastating diseases.",

    "question": "What is the role of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in immune regulation and cancer therapy?",
    "answer": "Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on T cells that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function. PD-1 binds to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are often upregulated in tumor cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. This interaction inhibits T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity, allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. Antibodies that block PD-1 or PD-L1 restore T-cell function and promote antitumor immunity, leading to durable responses in various cancers. However, not all patients respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and resistance can develop through mechanisms such as loss of PD-L1 expression, mutations in interferon signaling pathways, or immune cell exclusion from the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapies targeting multiple immune checkpoints or combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy or radiation are being explored to overcome resistance and improve outcomes in cancer patients.",

    "question": "How do viruses exploit host cell machinery for replication?",
    "answer": "Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on host cell machinery for replication. They utilize various strategies to hijack the host's cellular resources. For example, viruses attach to host cells via specific receptors, enter through endocytosis or membrane fusion, and then release their genetic material into the cytoplasm or nucleus. Viral genomes are replicated using host cell polymerases or virus-encoded polymerases. Viral mRNAs are translated by host ribosomes to produce viral proteins. Viruses can also manipulate host cell signaling pathways to create a more favorable environment for replication. For example, some viruses block apoptosis to prolong the lifespan of infected cells, while others suppress the host's immune response. Finally, newly synthesized viral components are assembled into virions, which are then released from the cell through lysis or budding, ready to infect new host cells. Understanding these viral replication strategies is crucial for developing antiviral therapies.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells acquire resistance to chemotherapy drugs?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy through various mechanisms. Increased drug efflux, mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters like P-glycoprotein, reduces intracellular drug concentration. Alterations in drug targets, such as mutations in the target enzyme or increased expression of the target protein, decrease drug binding affinity. Increased DNA repair capacity allows cancer cells to repair drug-induced DNA damage more efficiently. Deregulation of apoptosis pathways inhibits programmed cell death in response to chemotherapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers resistance by altering cell morphology and increasing migratory capacity. Epigenetic modifications and changes in the tumor microenvironment also contribute to chemoresistance. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is essential for developing strategies to overcome chemoresistance and improve cancer treatment outcomes.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and disease?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNA) to recipient cells. They play important roles in various physiological and pathological processes. In cancer, exosomes can promote tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis by delivering oncogenic proteins and miRNAs to neighboring cells. They also facilitate immune evasion by suppressing T-cell activity and promoting regulatory T-cell expansion. In neurodegenerative diseases, exosomes can spread misfolded proteins like amyloid-beta and tau, contributing to disease progression. Conversely, exosomes can also mediate beneficial effects by delivering therapeutic molecules to target cells. For example, exosomes derived from stem cells can promote tissue repair and regeneration. Exosomes are being explored as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and as drug delivery vehicles for targeted therapy.",

  {
    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications influence gene expression and cellular differentiation?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. DNA methylation, primarily occurring at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs), typically represses gene transcription by recruiting methyl-binding proteins and compacting chromatin structure. Histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, alter chromatin accessibility and affect gene expression positively or negatively depending on the specific modification and genomic context. These epigenetic marks are dynamically regulated by enzymes like DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Epigenetic modifications play crucial roles in cellular differentiation, development, and response to environmental stimuli. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are associated with various diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, are being developed as therapeutic agents to reverse abnormal epigenetic patterns and restore normal gene expression.",
