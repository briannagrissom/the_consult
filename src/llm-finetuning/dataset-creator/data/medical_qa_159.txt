    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 technology enable precise gene editing in mammalian cells, and what are the main challenges associated with its clinical translation?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise gene editing by utilizing a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the Cas9 nuclease to a specific DNA sequence within the genome. The Cas9 enzyme creates a double-stranded break at the targeted site, which the cell then repairs through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), often leading to gene disruption via insertions or deletions, or homology-directed repair (HDR), enabling precise gene insertion or replacement using a provided DNA template. Key challenges in clinical translation include off-target effects, where Cas9 cleaves unintended sites with similar sequences, potentially causing mutations at non-target genes; delivery challenges, as efficient and safe delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 components into target cells in vivo remains a hurdle; immune responses against Cas9 or other components, which can limit therapeutic efficacy and cause adverse effects; and ethical considerations, particularly regarding germline editing and potential long-term consequences.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and how do they contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cell death?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves several interconnected signaling pathways that lead to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid-beta (Aβ) production trigger downstream effects via multiple mechanisms, including activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) due to endoplasmic reticulum stress, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, and induction of oxidative stress. Aβ oligomers also activate inflammatory pathways through microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β, which exacerbate neuronal damage. Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation disrupt microtubule stability, impairing axonal transport and synaptic function, partly mediated by kinases such as GSK-3β and CDK5. Insulin signaling is often impaired in AD brains, leading to reduced glucose metabolism and increased Aβ production. Furthermore, impaired autophagy and proteasomal degradation pathways contribute to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates. These converging pathways ultimately lead to synaptic loss, neuronal apoptosis, and progressive cognitive decline.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation influence gene expression in cancer cells, and what are the therapeutic implications of targeting these modifications?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in cancer cells without altering the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands, often leads to gene silencing by recruiting methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes. In cancer, aberrant hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is a common mechanism of inactivation. Histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes gene transcription by relaxing chromatin structure. Conversely, histone deacetylation, catalyzed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), leads to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. Cancer cells often exhibit altered patterns of histone acetylation, contributing to oncogene activation and tumor suppressor silencing. Targeting these modifications with drugs like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and HDAC inhibitors can restore normal gene expression patterns and induce anti-tumor effects. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and minimizing off-target effects to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity.",

    "question": "What role do exosomes play in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment, and how can they be exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm) secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNA, DNA), and lipids to recipient cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, exosomes secreted by cancer cells can promote angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis by delivering oncogenic signals to surrounding stromal cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells. For example, exosomes can transfer drug resistance factors to neighboring cancer cells, promoting acquired resistance to chemotherapy. Conversely, immune cells can secrete exosomes containing anti-tumor signals to suppress cancer growth. Exosomes hold promise as diagnostic biomarkers due to their presence in easily accessible biofluids (e.g., blood, urine) and their ability to reflect the molecular composition of their cell of origin. Furthermore, exosomes can be engineered as therapeutic delivery vehicles by loading them with drugs, siRNA, or other therapeutic molecules and targeting them to specific cells or tissues. However, challenges remain in optimizing exosome isolation, purification, and targeting for clinical applications.",

    "question": "How do non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate gene expression and contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases?",
    "answer": "Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are key regulators of gene expression. MiRNAs are small (approximately 22 nucleotides) RNAs that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. LncRNAs are longer (>200 nucleotides) RNAs that can function as scaffolds, decoys, or guides to regulate gene expression at various levels, including transcription, splicing, and translation. In cardiovascular diseases, specific miRNAs and lncRNAs have been shown to play critical roles. For example, miR-133 is involved in cardiac hypertrophy, while miR-21 regulates cardiac fibrosis. LncRNAs such as MIAT and ANRIL have been implicated in atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. These non-coding RNAs can affect a wide range of processes, including cardiomyocyte differentiation, endothelial function, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Targeting these non-coding RNAs with therapeutic approaches, such as antisense oligonucleotides or miRNA mimics, holds promise for treating cardiovascular diseases.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, enhance anti-tumor immunity, and what are the mechanisms underlying immune-related adverse events (irAEs)?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, enhance anti-tumor immunity by blocking inhibitory signals that normally dampen T-cell activation. CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, inhibits T-cell activation by competing with CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Blocking CTLA-4 enhances T-cell priming and activation in the lymph nodes. PD-1, also expressed on T cells, binds to PD-L1 on tumor cells and APCs, inhibiting T-cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment. Blocking PD-1 restores T-cell activity and allows for tumor cell killing. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occur because checkpoint inhibitors unleash T-cell activity against normal tissues, leading to inflammation and organ damage. The mechanisms underlying irAEs are complex and multifactorial, involving T-cell recognition of self-antigens, cytokine release, and complement activation. Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in immune-related genes, may also contribute to the risk of irAEs. Management of irAEs typically involves corticosteroids and, in severe cases, other immunosuppressive agents.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, and what are the implications for cancer prevention and treatment?",
    "answer": "Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, which encode proteins involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination, increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer by impairing the cell's ability to accurately repair DNA damage. This leads to the accumulation of mutations and genomic instability, driving tumorigenesis. BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins form a complex that interacts with other proteins to repair double-strand DNA breaks. When these proteins are non-functional due to mutations, cells rely on alternative, error-prone DNA repair pathways, increasing the likelihood of mutations that promote cancer development. For cancer prevention, individuals with BRCA1/2 mutations may consider prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy to reduce their risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. For cancer treatment, tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations are often sensitive to PARP inhibitors, which block an alternative DNA repair pathway, leading to synthetic lethality in cells with impaired homologous recombination. Platinum-based chemotherapy agents are also commonly used to treat BRCA1/2-associated cancers, as they induce DNA damage that cannot be effectively repaired in these cells.",

    "question": "How do viruses, such as HIV and influenza, evade the host immune system, and what strategies are being developed to overcome these evasion mechanisms?",
    "answer": "Viruses evade the host immune system through diverse mechanisms, including antigenic variation (mutation), latency, direct immune cell suppression, and interference with immune signaling pathways. HIV evades immune detection by rapidly mutating its surface glycoproteins (e.g., gp120), leading to the emergence of viral variants that are not recognized by existing antibodies. HIV also infects and depletes CD4+ T cells, which are crucial for coordinating the immune response. Influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift (gradual accumulation of mutations) and antigenic shift (reassortment of viral genome segments), allowing them to escape antibody-mediated neutralization. Both viruses suppress interferon responses, which are critical for antiviral defense. Strategies to overcome viral evasion include developing broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved viral epitopes, designing vaccines that elicit broadly protective T-cell responses, and using antiviral drugs that target viral proteins essential for replication. Immunotherapies that boost the host's immune response are also being explored.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms by which gut microbiota influence host immunity, and how can manipulation of the gut microbiome be used to treat or prevent diseases?",
    "answer": "Gut microbiota influence host immunity through several key mechanisms. They provide colonization resistance against pathogenic bacteria, produce metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that modulate immune cell function, and directly interact with immune cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). SCFAs, such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate, are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers and can promote regulatory T-cell (Treg) development, suppress inflammatory cytokine production, and enhance intestinal barrier function. Gut microbiota also shape the development and education of the immune system in early life, influencing the balance between pro-inflammatory and tolerogenic responses. Manipulation of the gut microbiome can be achieved through dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and probiotics or prebiotics. FMT has shown success in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, while probiotics and prebiotics are being investigated for their potential to prevent or treat inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, and metabolic disorders. However, challenges remain in understanding the complex interactions between gut microbiota and the host immune system and in developing targeted microbiome-based therapies.",

    "question": "How does the Warburg effect contribute to cancer cell metabolism and growth, and what are the therapeutic strategies targeting altered metabolic pathways in cancer?",
    "answer": "The Warburg effect describes the phenomenon where cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis for energy production, even in the presence of oxygen, leading to increased glucose uptake and lactate production. This metabolic switch provides cancer cells with several advantages. First, glycolysis produces ATP more rapidly than oxidative phosphorylation, allowing for faster cell proliferation. Second, glycolytic intermediates are diverted into biosynthetic pathways, providing building blocks for cell growth and division. Third, the acidic microenvironment created by lactate production promotes tumor invasion and metastasis. Therapeutic strategies targeting altered metabolic pathways in cancer include glucose metabolism inhibitors (e.g., 2-deoxyglucose), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) inhibitors, glutaminase inhibitors, and inhibitors of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Targeting mitochondrial metabolism is also being explored, as some cancer cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation. Combining metabolic inhibitors with chemotherapy or immunotherapy may enhance treatment efficacy by disrupting cancer cell metabolism and sensitizing them to other therapies.",
