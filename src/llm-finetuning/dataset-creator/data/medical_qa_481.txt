    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology enable precise modification of the human genome, and what are the key limitations?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA sequence, creating a double-stranded break. The cell's repair mechanisms then either disrupt the gene via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or introduce a desired sequence via homology-directed repair (HDR) if a template is provided. Key advantages include its simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability across various organisms. However, limitations include off-target effects (cleavage at unintended sites due to sequence similarity), mosaicism (incomplete editing within a population of cells), and delivery challenges, particularly in vivo where efficient and targeted delivery to the desired tissue remains a significant hurdle. Ethical concerns regarding germline editing and potential unintended consequences also necessitate careful consideration and regulation.",

    "question": "What are the primary mechanisms by which metformin exerts its antihyperglycemic effects in patients with type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It also increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, enhancing glucose uptake and utilization. Furthermore, metformin modulates the gut microbiome and increases GLP-1 secretion, contributing to improved glucose control. At the molecular level, metformin activates AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), which plays a central role in regulating cellular energy balance and metabolic pathways involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. The precise mechanisms are still being elucidated, but AMPK activation appears to be a key mediator of metformin's therapeutic effects.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitor therapies like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies enhance antitumor immunity, and what are the common immune-related adverse events?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors block inhibitory signals that normally dampen T-cell activation. Anti-PD-1 antibodies block the interaction between PD-1 (expressed on T cells) and PD-L1 (expressed on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells), preventing T-cell exhaustion and restoring their ability to kill tumor cells. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies block CTLA-4, a receptor on T cells that competes with the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 for binding to B7 on antigen-presenting cells, thus enhancing T-cell activation early in the immune response. Common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies (e.g., thyroiditis, hypophysitis), and dermatologic toxicities. These irAEs arise from the unleashed immune response targeting not only tumor cells but also normal tissues. Management involves corticosteroids and, in severe cases, immunosuppressants like infliximab or mycophenolate mofetil.",

    "question": "What are the roles of different types of immune cells (e.g., T cells, B cells, NK cells) in controlling viral infections, and how do viruses evade these immune responses?",
    "answer": "T cells (CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes) directly kill virus-infected cells by recognizing viral antigens presented on MHC class I molecules. CD4+ helper T cells provide crucial support to other immune cells by secreting cytokines that activate macrophages, B cells, and CD8+ T cells. B cells produce antibodies that neutralize viruses, preventing them from infecting cells, and also mark infected cells for destruction by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Natural killer (NK) cells kill infected cells that have reduced MHC class I expression, a common viral evasion strategy. Viruses evade these responses through various mechanisms, including: antigenic variation (mutating viral proteins to escape antibody recognition), downregulating MHC class I expression (to evade CD8+ T cells), producing decoy receptors that bind to cytokines, and infecting immune cells themselves (e.g., HIV infecting CD4+ T cells).",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and what are the implications for genetic testing and risk-reduction strategies?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination. Mutations in these genes impair the cell's ability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks accurately, leading to genomic instability and increased risk of cancer development. Specifically, loss of BRCA1/2 function results in accumulation of mutations that drive uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation, particularly in breast and ovarian tissues. Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 mutations is recommended for individuals with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, or related cancers. Positive test results can inform risk-reduction strategies such as prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy, as well as enhanced surveillance. PARP inhibitors, which target tumors with defective DNA repair mechanisms, are also an effective treatment option for BRCA1/2-mutated cancers.",

    "question": "How does the dysregulation of the gut microbiome contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and what are the potential therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome?",
    "answer": "In IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), there is a disruption of the normal gut microbiome composition and function, termed dysbiosis. This involves a decrease in beneficial commensal bacteria (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes) and an increase in pathobionts (e.g., adherent-invasive E. coli, Fusobacterium). Dysbiosis disrupts the intestinal barrier, leading to increased permeability and translocation of microbial products into the lamina propria, triggering an exaggerated immune response. This immune response is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-23) that perpetuate chronic inflammation. Therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome include: fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to restore a healthy microbial community, dietary interventions to modulate the microbiome composition, prebiotics and probiotics to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, and selective antibiotics to reduce the abundance of pathobionts. However, the optimal approach for manipulating the microbiome in IBD remains an area of active investigation.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms of action of various classes of anti-cancer drugs, such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and topoisomerase inhibitors?",
    "answer": "Alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, cisplatin) directly damage DNA by forming covalent bonds with DNA bases, leading to DNA crosslinking and strand breaks, which disrupt DNA replication and transcription. Antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) interfere with DNA synthesis by mimicking natural building blocks of DNA or by inhibiting enzymes involved in nucleotide synthesis. For example, methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, a crucial cofactor in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, irinotecan) target topoisomerases, enzymes that regulate DNA topology during replication and transcription. These drugs either stabilize the cleavable complex formed between topoisomerase and DNA (e.g., etoposide) or prevent the religation of DNA strands after cleavage (e.g., irinotecan), leading to DNA damage and cell death.",

    "question": "How do extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles, mediate intercellular communication in cancer, and what is their potential as therapeutic targets?",
    "answer": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale vesicles released by cells that contain a cargo of proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA), and lipids. Exosomes (30-150 nm) are formed within endosomes and released upon fusion with the plasma membrane, while microvesicles (100-1000 nm) bud directly from the plasma membrane. In cancer, EVs mediate intercellular communication by transferring their cargo to recipient cells, influencing various processes such as tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. For example, tumor-derived exosomes can promote angiogenesis by delivering pro-angiogenic factors to endothelial cells, or they can suppress immune cell activity by transferring immunosuppressive molecules. EVs also play a role in drug resistance by transferring drug efflux pumps or signaling molecules that activate survival pathways. EVs are being explored as therapeutic targets through strategies such as: inhibiting EV biogenesis or release, blocking EV uptake by recipient cells, or engineering EVs to deliver therapeutic payloads (e.g., siRNAs, drugs) specifically to tumor cells.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease, and how can these pathways be targeted for therapeutic intervention?",
    "answer": "Several signaling pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are hallmark pathological features. Aβ accumulation activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to ER stress and neuronal dysfunction. Tau hyperphosphorylation is regulated by kinases like GSK-3β and CDK5, which are activated by inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis also contributes to neuronal excitotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction. Therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways include: beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors to reduce Aβ production, tau aggregation inhibitors to prevent NFT formation, GSK-3β and CDK5 inhibitors to reduce tau phosphorylation, and agents that restore calcium homeostasis. Additionally, immunotherapies targeting Aβ plaques are being developed to promote their clearance from the brain. Modulation of neuroinflammation and enhancement of synaptic plasticity are also promising therapeutic avenues.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy, and what are the strategies to overcome drug resistance?",

Strategies to overcome drug resistance include: developing new drugs that circumvent resistance mechanisms, using combination therapies that target multiple pathways, inhibiting drug efflux pumps, targeting survival signaling pathways, and exploiting synthetic lethality (targeting genes that are essential for survival only in the presence of a specific mutation or drug). Personalized medicine approaches, guided by genomic and proteomic profiling of tumors, can also help to identify the most effective treatment strategies for individual patients and minimize the development of resistance.",
