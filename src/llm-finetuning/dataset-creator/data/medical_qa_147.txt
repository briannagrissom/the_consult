    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work at the molecular level?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 employs a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a target DNA sequence, directing the Cas9 nuclease to create a double-stranded break (DSB) at that specific genomic locus. The cell's endogenous DNA repair mechanisms then come into play. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) can introduce insertions or deletions (indels), often disrupting the gene's reading frame and leading to loss-of-function mutations. Alternatively, if a donor DNA template with homology to the target site is provided, homology-directed repair (HDR) can precisely integrate the desired sequence into the genome. The specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 depends critically on the gRNA sequence and the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence downstream of the target site. Off-target effects, where Cas9 cleaves unintended sites with similar sequences, remain a significant challenge. Current research focuses on improving Cas9 specificity through modified Cas9 variants with enhanced fidelity, optimized gRNA design algorithms, and delivery methods to minimize off-target activity and maximize on-target efficiency.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Several signaling pathways are critically implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing via β- and γ-secretases leads to the production and aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, activating microglia and triggering inflammatory cascades mediated by NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Aβ oligomers also disrupt synaptic function by interfering with long-term potentiation and depressing glutamate receptor signaling. Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein results in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting microtubule stability and axonal transport. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, crucial for cell growth and survival, is often dysregulated in AD brains, contributing to neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, reduced insulin signaling and impaired glucose metabolism exacerbate Aβ production and tau phosphorylation. Chronic inflammation induced by activated microglia and astrocytes releases pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), further promoting neuronal damage. Understanding the complex interplay of these pathways is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or delaying AD progression.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, work by blocking inhibitory signaling pathways that normally dampen T-cell activation and effector function. CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, competes with CD28 for binding to B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), delivering an inhibitory signal that prevents full T-cell activation. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies block this interaction, promoting T-cell priming and expansion in the lymph nodes. PD-1, also expressed on T cells, binds to PD-L1 and PD-L2 on tumor cells and APCs, delivering an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activity in the tumor microenvironment. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies disrupt this interaction, restoring T-cell cytotoxicity and enabling them to kill tumor cells. By releasing these inhibitory signals, checkpoint inhibitors unleash the T-cell response against cancer cells, leading to durable tumor regression in some patients. However, this enhanced immune activation can also lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to autoimmunity.",

    "question": "What is the role of the microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Dysbiosis, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and an imbalance between beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, is a hallmark of IBD. Specifically, a decrease in Firmicutes (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, known for its anti-inflammatory properties) and an increase in Proteobacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli) are frequently observed. These microbial imbalances can disrupt the intestinal barrier, leading to increased permeability and translocation of bacteria and their products (e.g., lipopolysaccharide, LPS) into the lamina propria. This triggers an exaggerated immune response, with activation of immune cells (e.g., macrophages, T cells) and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6). Moreover, microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, which are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers, are reduced in IBD patients, further impairing intestinal health. Understanding the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and the host immune system is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or the use of prebiotics and probiotics, to restore microbial balance and alleviate IBD symptoms.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes that play a critical role in DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination repair (HRR). They are essential for maintaining genomic stability. BRCA1 forms a complex with other proteins, including BRCA2, RAD51, and PALB2, to repair double-strand DNA breaks. When BRCA1 or BRCA2 is mutated, the HRR pathway is impaired, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability. This increased genomic instability promotes uncontrolled cell growth and division, increasing the risk of developing various cancers, particularly breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Furthermore, cells with BRCA1/2 mutations become more reliant on alternative DNA repair pathways, such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and further contributes to genomic instability. The loss of BRCA1/2 function also makes cancer cells more sensitive to certain therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, which exploit the impaired DNA repair capacity of these cells, leading to synthetic lethality.",

    "question": "What is the mechanism of action of metformin in treating type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin's primary mechanism of action involves reducing hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK activation in the liver suppresses the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Metformin also improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, such as muscle and adipose tissue, enhancing glucose uptake and utilization. Furthermore, it has been shown to modulate the gut microbiome, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and altering bile acid metabolism, which contributes to its glucose-lowering effects. Metformin also reduces intestinal glucose absorption. These multiple mechanisms of action make metformin a highly effective first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, lowering blood glucose levels without causing significant hypoglycemia in most patients.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse strategies to evade the host immune system. They can interfere with the interferon (IFN) pathway, a crucial antiviral defense mechanism. Some viruses encode proteins that inhibit IFN production or block IFN signaling, preventing the induction of antiviral genes. They can also downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells, making them less recognizable by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Many viruses exhibit high mutation rates, allowing them to rapidly evolve and escape antibody recognition (antigenic drift). Some viruses establish latency, remaining dormant within host cells for extended periods, avoiding immune detection. Others employ decoy mechanisms, producing soluble proteins that bind to neutralizing antibodies, preventing them from targeting infected cells. Viruses can also actively suppress immune cell function by expressing immunomodulatory cytokines or inducing apoptosis of immune cells. These multifaceted immune evasion strategies contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm) secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA) to recipient cells. In cancer, exosomes play a crucial role in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes can modify the tumor microenvironment by delivering pro-angiogenic factors, promoting the formation of new blood vessels that supply nutrients to the tumor. They can also suppress immune cell activity, inhibiting T-cell function and promoting the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which further dampen antitumor immunity. Exosomes can also transport microRNAs (miRNAs) that alter gene expression in recipient cells, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step in metastasis. Furthermore, exosomes can facilitate the formation of pre-metastatic niches by preparing distant organs for tumor cell arrival, recruiting immune cells and modifying the extracellular matrix. Understanding the role of exosomes in cancer progression is essential for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, such as exosome-based biomarkers for early cancer detection or exosome-based drug delivery systems to target cancer cells.",

    "question": "How does gene therapy work, and what are the different types of gene therapy vectors?",
    "answer": "Gene therapy involves introducing genetic material into cells to treat or prevent disease. It aims to correct defective genes, introduce new genes, or modify gene expression. Gene therapy vectors are vehicles used to deliver the therapeutic gene into target cells. Viral vectors are commonly used due to their high efficiency in transducing cells. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are non-pathogenic and can transduce a wide range of cell types with long-term gene expression, but they have a limited packaging capacity. Adenoviral vectors can carry larger genes but elicit a strong immune response. Lentiviral vectors can integrate into the host genome, providing stable gene expression, but there is a risk of insertional mutagenesis. Non-viral vectors, such as plasmids and liposomes, are less efficient than viral vectors but have lower immunogenicity and can carry larger genes. Naked DNA can be directly injected into tissues, but it has low transfection efficiency. Ex vivo gene therapy involves modifying cells outside the body and then transplanting them back into the patient. In vivo gene therapy involves directly injecting the vector into the patient. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, can be used to precisely correct defective genes within cells. The choice of gene therapy vector depends on the target tissue, the size of the therapeutic gene, the desired duration of gene expression, and the potential for immunogenicity.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics in bacteria?",
    "answer": "Bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms to resist antibiotics, including enzymatic inactivation, target modification, efflux pumps, and reduced permeability. Enzymatic inactivation involves the production of enzymes, such as beta-lactamases, that degrade or modify antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Target modification involves altering the structure of the antibiotic's target site, preventing it from binding and exerting its effect. For example, mutations in the ribosomal RNA can confer resistance to macrolides. Efflux pumps actively transport antibiotics out of the bacterial cell, reducing their intracellular concentration. Reduced permeability involves altering the bacterial cell membrane to prevent antibiotics from entering the cell. Horizontal gene transfer, such as conjugation, transduction, and transformation, allows bacteria to acquire resistance genes from other bacteria, contributing to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals have driven the selection and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a significant threat to public health.",
