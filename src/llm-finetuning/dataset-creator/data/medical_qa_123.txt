    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain lead to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC frequently arises from secondary mutations within the EGFR kinase domain, with the most common being the T790M mutation. This mutation sterically hinders the binding of reversible EGFR TKIs to the ATP-binding pocket. Other less frequent resistance mechanisms involve mutations such as C797S, which prevents covalent binding of some third-generation EGFR inhibitors, or mutations that activate bypass signaling pathways like MET amplification or activation of downstream kinases such as PI3K/AKT. The development of resistance is a complex evolutionary process influenced by factors like intratumoral heterogeneity and selective pressure from EGFR TKI therapy. Detailed molecular profiling is essential to identify resistance mechanisms and guide subsequent treatment strategies, including the use of novel EGFR inhibitors designed to overcome specific resistance mutations or combination therapies targeting bypass pathways.

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in IBD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis, characterized by decreased microbial diversity and an altered composition of bacterial species, is a hallmark of IBD. Specific bacterial taxa, such as adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) and certain strains of Bacteroides, have been implicated in promoting intestinal inflammation. Conversely, commensal bacteria, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacteria, exert protective effects by producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which fuel colonocytes and modulate immune responses. Genetic susceptibility (e.g., NOD2 mutations), environmental factors, and immune dysregulation interact with the microbiome to drive IBD. The altered microbiome can disrupt intestinal barrier function, enhance antigen presentation, and activate pro-inflammatory pathways, leading to chronic inflammation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions are being explored as therapeutic strategies to restore microbial balance and alleviate IBD symptoms. [PMID: 23626377]",

    "question": "How do prions cause neurodegenerative diseases?",
    "answer": "Prions are misfolded proteins that propagate their abnormal conformation by converting normally folded versions of the same protein. In prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the prion protein (PrPSc) acts as a template to convert the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the pathogenic form. This process leads to the accumulation of PrPSc aggregates in the brain, which are highly resistant to degradation and form amyloid plaques. These aggregates disrupt neuronal function and trigger neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal death and the characteristic spongiform changes observed in prion-affected brains. The precise mechanisms by which PrPSc induces neurotoxicity are still being investigated, but they likely involve impaired protein degradation pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of apoptotic signaling cascades. The infectious nature of prions, their resistance to conventional sterilization methods, and the lack of effective therapies pose significant challenges in managing prion diseases. [PMID: 19188611]",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves several key signaling pathways that contribute to its pathogenesis. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, are hallmarks of AD. Aβ accumulation activates inflammatory pathways, including microglia and astrocyte activation, leading to the release of cytokines and chemokines. Aβ also disrupts synaptic function and calcium homeostasis, contributing to excitotoxicity and neuronal damage. Tau hyperphosphorylation impairs microtubule stability and axonal transport. The GSK-3β and CDK5 kinases are major players in tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, impaired insulin signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress exacerbate neuronal vulnerability in AD. Genetic factors, such as APOE4, influence Aβ clearance and aggregation. Therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways, including anti-amyloid antibodies and tau-directed therapies, are being developed to slow disease progression. [PMID: 28623114]",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, enhance anti-tumor immunity by blocking inhibitory signaling pathways that normally dampen T-cell responses. CTLA-4 blockade primarily enhances T-cell activation in lymph nodes by preventing CTLA-4 from outcompeting CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells. PD-1 inhibitors, on the other hand, mainly act in the tumor microenvironment by blocking the interaction between PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. This prevents PD-1 signaling from inhibiting T-cell effector functions, such as cytokine production and cytotoxicity. By blocking these inhibitory checkpoints, T cells can mount a more effective anti-tumor response. Combination strategies targeting multiple checkpoints or combining checkpoint inhibitors with other immunotherapies are being explored to further enhance anti-tumor immunity. [PMID: 25519181]",

    "question": "How does RNA interference (RNAi) work to silence gene expression?",
    "answer": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful mechanism of gene silencing. It begins with the processing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the enzyme Dicer into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of about 21-23 nucleotides. One strand of the siRNA is then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which uses the siRNA as a guide to find complementary mRNA sequences. Once the RISC-siRNA complex binds to the target mRNA, it can either cleave the mRNA, leading to its degradation, or repress its translation. Another class of small RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), also utilizes the RISC complex but typically binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, resulting in translational repression or mRNA destabilization. RNAi has become a valuable tool for studying gene function and developing new therapeutics, as it allows for precise and targeted silencing of specific genes. [PMID: 11050446]",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) that mediate intercellular communication by transferring various biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNAs and microRNAs), between cells. In cancer, exosomes play a critical role in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes can deliver oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to recipient cells, altering their behavior and promoting tumor progression. For example, exosomes can transfer matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to the tumor microenvironment, facilitating extracellular matrix degradation and invasion. Exosomes can also educate distant pre-metastatic niches by preparing them for the arrival of metastatic cells. Furthermore, exosomes can suppress immune responses by delivering immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells. Exosomes are being explored as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and as therapeutic targets to inhibit cancer metastasis. [PMID: 23599269]",

    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9) is a revolutionary gene editing technology derived from the adaptive immune system of bacteria. It involves two key components: the Cas9 protein, which acts as a molecular scissor, and a guide RNA (gRNA), which is a short RNA sequence complementary to the target DNA sequence. The gRNA directs the Cas9 protein to the specific location in the genome where a cut is desired. Once Cas9 binds to the target DNA, it creates a double-stranded break (DSB). The cell then repairs the DSB through one of two main pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can lead to insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt gene function, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which uses a provided DNA template to precisely repair the break and introduce specific sequence changes. CRISPR-Cas9 has transformed biomedical research and holds immense promise for treating genetic diseases. [PMID: 22841004]",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms of action of metformin in treating type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin, a first-line drug for type 2 diabetes, primarily acts by reducing hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis. It also enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle, leading to increased glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy metabolism, which contributes to its effects on glucose homeostasis. Additionally, metformin may modulate the gut microbiome and alter bile acid metabolism, contributing to its overall glucose-lowering effects. While the precise molecular mechanisms of metformin are still being investigated, its ability to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce hepatic glucose production makes it an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes.

Additionally, cancer cells can develop resistance through epigenetic modifications and changes in the tumor microenvironment that limit drug penetration or promote cell survival. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance and improve cancer treatment outcomes. [PMID: 24890630]",
