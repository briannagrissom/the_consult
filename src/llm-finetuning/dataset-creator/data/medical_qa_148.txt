    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain confer resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase are frequent drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), sensitizing tumors to first-generation EGFR inhibitors like gefitinib and erlotinib. However, acquired resistance invariably emerges, most commonly due to the secondary T790M mutation within exon 20 of EGFR. This mutation sterically hinders inhibitor binding by increasing the affinity of EGFR for ATP, thereby restoring EGFR signaling even in the presence of the drug. The T790M mutation also increases the steric bulk around the drug-binding pocket, reducing the affinity of reversible EGFR inhibitors. Alternative resistance mechanisms include MET amplification, which activates downstream signaling pathways independently of EGFR; small cell transformation, which bypasses EGFR dependence altogether; and activation of bypass pathways such as PI3K/AKT. Third-generation EGFR inhibitors, such as osimertinib, were specifically designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by forming irreversible covalent bonds with EGFR, including the mutant form. However, even these agents eventually encounter resistance, often through mutations such as C797S that prevent covalent binding. Combinatorial strategies targeting multiple resistance mechanisms are under active investigation to prolong the efficacy of EGFR-directed therapies.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a critical role in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses, influencing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Certain bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma and other cancers, potentially by enhancing dendritic cell activation and T-cell priming in the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, dysbiosis—characterized by reduced microbial diversity and the presence of opportunistic pathogens—can dampen antitumor immunity and promote immune-related adverse events. The mechanisms underlying these effects are complex and involve the production of microbial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that influence immune cell function, as well as direct interactions between bacteria and immune cells via pattern recognition receptors. Preclinical studies have shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from ICI-responsive patients can transfer therapeutic benefit to ICI-resistant recipients, highlighting the causal role of the microbiome. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as dietary interventions, probiotics, and FMT, are being actively investigated as potential approaches to enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of cancer immunotherapy.",

    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Chronic neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While initial inflammatory responses may be neuroprotective by clearing amyloid-beta plaques and damaged neurons, sustained activation of microglia and astrocytes leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) and reactive oxygen species. These mediators exacerbate neuronal dysfunction and synaptic loss by disrupting calcium homeostasis, impairing mitochondrial function, and increasing oxidative stress. Inflammatory signaling also promotes the phosphorylation of tau protein, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of AD. Furthermore, chronic inflammation can impair the clearance of amyloid-beta by reducing the expression of amyloid-degrading enzymes and disrupting the blood-brain barrier, which further promotes plaque accumulation. Genetic studies have identified several immune-related genes, such as TREM2 and CD33, as risk factors for AD, highlighting the importance of microglia function in disease pathogenesis. Therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation, such as anti-inflammatory drugs and immunomodulatory therapies, are under investigation as potential approaches to slow the progression of AD.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which viruses evade host immune responses?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to evade both innate and adaptive immune responses, enabling them to establish persistent infections. Strategies to interfere with the interferon (IFN) pathway are common, as IFN signaling is crucial for antiviral defense. Some viruses encode proteins that directly inhibit IFN production or block downstream signaling events, such as STAT phosphorylation. Viruses also employ strategies to evade recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like TLRs and RIG-I by sequestering their genomes, modifying viral RNA to prevent detection, or encoding proteins that interfere with PRR signaling. To evade adaptive immunity, viruses can undergo rapid mutation, generating antigenic variants that are no longer recognized by antibodies or T cells. Some viruses downregulate the expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells, thereby preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Others encode proteins that directly inhibit CTL function or induce the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10. Latency, a state of viral dormancy, is another effective evasion strategy, allowing viruses to persist in the host without eliciting strong immune responses. The specific evasion mechanisms employed vary depending on the virus and the host species.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications influence the development and progression of cancer?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are frequently observed in cancer and contribute to tumorigenesis by silencing tumor suppressor genes, activating oncogenes, and promoting genomic instability. DNA methylation, particularly at CpG islands in promoter regions, can lead to transcriptional repression of genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, also influence gene expression by altering chromatin structure and accessibility. For example, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones, leading to chromatin condensation and gene silencing. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), can regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA and inhibiting translation or promoting mRNA degradation. Epigenetic modifications are often reversible, making them attractive targets for cancer therapy. Drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) or HDACs have shown promise in treating certain types of cancer by restoring the expression of silenced tumor suppressor genes.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms of action of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents?",
    "answer": "Chemotherapeutic agents exert their cytotoxic effects through diverse mechanisms targeting essential cellular processes. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, introduce alkyl groups into DNA, disrupting its structure and function. Antimetabolites, like methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil, interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis by mimicking natural metabolites. Topoisomerase inhibitors, such as etoposide and irinotecan, block the activity of topoisomerases, enzymes that regulate DNA topology during replication and transcription. Microtubule inhibitors, including paclitaxel and vincristine, disrupt microtubule dynamics, interfering with cell division. Platinum-based drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, form DNA adducts, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis. The specific mechanism of action and the resulting cellular effects vary depending on the agent and the type of cancer cell. Chemotherapeutic agents often target rapidly dividing cells, making them effective against cancer but also causing side effects in normal tissues with high proliferative rates.",

    "question": "How do vaccines elicit protective immunity against viral infections?",
    "answer": "Vaccines stimulate the immune system to develop protective immunity against viral infections without causing disease. Traditional vaccines contain inactivated or attenuated viruses, while newer vaccines may contain viral proteins or nucleic acids. Upon administration, vaccine antigens are processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, which then present viral peptides to T cells. This leads to the activation of helper T cells, which promote the differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing plasma cells. Antibodies neutralize viruses by blocking their entry into cells or by promoting their clearance by phagocytes. Vaccines also stimulate the development of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which recognize and kill virus-infected cells. Memory B cells and memory T cells are generated during vaccination, providing long-lasting immunity. Upon subsequent exposure to the virus, these memory cells rapidly mount a robust immune response, preventing or mitigating infection. The effectiveness of a vaccine depends on several factors, including the type of vaccine, the viral antigen used, and the individual's immune status.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and disease pathogenesis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) that are secreted by cells and mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (including mRNA and microRNA) to recipient cells. They are formed within multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and released upon fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane. Exosomes play a critical role in both normal physiological processes and disease pathogenesis. In the immune system, exosomes can present antigens to T cells and modulate immune responses. In cancer, exosomes can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis by transferring oncogenic proteins and miRNAs to neighboring cells and distant sites. Exosomes can also contribute to drug resistance by exporting chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells or by transferring resistance-conferring molecules. The composition of exosomes reflects the state of the cell from which they originate, making them potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Exosomes are also being explored as drug delivery vehicles, as they can be engineered to carry therapeutic agents to specific target cells.",

    "question": "How do mutations in DNA repair genes contribute to cancer susceptibility?",
    "answer": "Mutations in DNA repair genes increase cancer susceptibility by impairing the cell's ability to repair DNA damage, leading to the accumulation of mutations and genomic instability. DNA repair pathways, such as mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and homologous recombination (HR), are essential for maintaining genomic integrity. Mutations in MMR genes, such as MLH1 and MSH2, cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers. Mutations in NER genes, such as XPA and XPC, cause xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which increases the risk of skin cancer due to impaired repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Mutations in HR genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers due to impaired repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Individuals with inherited mutations in DNA repair genes are more likely to develop cancer at a younger age and to develop multiple primary cancers. Genetic testing for DNA repair gene mutations is often recommended for individuals with a strong family history of cancer.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Several major signaling pathways are dysregulated in T2D, contributing to its pathogenesis. The insulin signaling pathway, initiated by insulin binding to its receptor, is impaired due to insulin resistance in target tissues such as muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. This leads to decreased glucose uptake and utilization, resulting in hyperglycemia. The glucagon signaling pathway, which promotes glucose production in the liver, is also dysregulated, contributing to hyperglycemia. The incretin signaling pathway, involving hormones such as GLP-1 and GIP, is impaired, leading to reduced insulin secretion and increased glucagon secretion. The AMPK signaling pathway, which regulates energy metabolism, is also dysregulated, contributing to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism. Inflammation and oxidative stress also play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D by impairing insulin signaling and promoting beta-cell dysfunction. Targeting these signaling pathways is a major focus of T2D drug development.",
