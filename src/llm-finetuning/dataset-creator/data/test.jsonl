Key components of the TME that promote metastasis include cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and soluble factors. CAFs remodel the ECM, secrete growth factors and cytokines, and promote angiogenesis, creating a permissive environment for tumor cell invasion. Immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), can suppress antitumor immunity and promote tumor cell survival and migration. Endothelial cells form new blood vessels that provide nutrients and oxygen to the growing tumor and serve as conduits for tumor cell dissemination. The ECM provides a scaffold for tumor cells and contains adhesion molecules and growth factors that promote cell attachment, migration, and survival. Soluble factors, such as chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), regulate tumor cell behavior, angiogenesis, and ECM remodeling. Interactions between tumor cells and the TME are complex and dynamic, with reciprocal signaling that promotes both local invasion and distant metastasis. Targeting the TME is an area of active research, with strategies aimed at disrupting angiogenesis, modulating immune cell function, and inhibiting ECM remodeling."}]}]}

Although EGFR TKIs initially demonstrate high efficacy in patients with EGFR-activating mutations (e.g., exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations), most patients eventually develop acquired resistance. The most common mechanism of acquired resistance is the development of the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20, which sterically hinders the binding of first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs. Other less frequent mechanisms of resistance include: bypass signaling activation (e.g., MET amplification, HER2 amplification, PI3K\/AKT activation), histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and the emergence of other EGFR mutations (e.g., C797S). MET amplification leads to activation of the MET signaling pathway, which bypasses the EGFR inhibition and promotes cell survival and proliferation. Histologic transformation to SCLC is characterized by loss of EGFR mutation and gain of neuroendocrine features. The C797S mutation in EGFR can confer resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs is crucial for developing strategies to overcome resistance and improve treatment outcomes. Combination therapies targeting multiple signaling pathways, as well as novel EGFR TKIs that are active against resistant mutations, are being developed and evaluated in clinical trials."}]}]}

It profoundly influences cancer progression by promoting tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Cancer cells actively remodel the TME to their advantage by secreting cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes that recruit and reprogram stromal cells. For example, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secrete growth factors like HGF and TGF-\u03b2, which stimulate tumor cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immune cells within the TME can be either pro-tumorigenic (e.g., M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells) or anti-tumorigenic (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes, NK cells), depending on the balance of immune-stimulatory and immune-suppressive signals. Furthermore, the TME can protect tumor cells from chemotherapy and radiation by limiting drug penetration, inducing hypoxia, and activating survival pathways. Hypoxia, in particular, promotes angiogenesis and increases the expression of drug efflux pumps, reducing the efficacy of cytotoxic agents. The TME also plays a crucial role in immune evasion by expressing immune checkpoint molecules (e.g., PD-L1) and recruiting immunosuppressive cells. Targeting the TME is therefore an attractive strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance and improve cancer outcomes. Approaches include inhibiting angiogenesis, depleting CAFs, modulating immune cell activity, and disrupting the extracellular matrix. Combination therapies that target both cancer cells and the TME are showing promise in preclinical and clinical studies."}]}]}

By bringing the target protein into close proximity with the E3 ligase, the PROTAC promotes ubiquitination of the target protein, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Unlike traditional small-molecule inhibitors, which only inhibit the function of a protein, PROTACs eliminate the target protein altogether. This can be particularly advantageous for proteins that are difficult to inhibit with traditional inhibitors or for proteins that have non-catalytic functions.

Histone acetylation, for example, generally promotes gene expression by relaxing chromatin structure and allowing access to transcription factors, while histone methylation can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the specific histone residue modified. In normal development, epigenetic modifications regulate cell differentiation and tissue-specific gene expression patterns. In cancer, aberrant epigenetic modifications can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of oncogenes, contributing to tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations are often reversible, making them attractive therapeutic targets. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis), such as azacitidine and decitabine, can reverse DNA methylation and reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), such as vorinostat and romidepsin, inhibit histone deacetylation and promote chromatin relaxation, leading to increased gene expression.

The microbiome interacts with the host immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), triggering inflammatory cascades. Dysbiosis can disrupt intestinal barrier integrity, leading to increased permeability and translocation of bacteria into the lamina propria, further activating immune responses. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, play a critical role in maintaining intestinal health by providing energy to colonocytes and modulating immune function. Decreased SCFA production in IBD contributes to impaired barrier function and inflammation. Genetic factors, such as NOD2 mutations, influence the host's ability to recognize and respond to microbial stimuli, increasing IBD susceptibility.

Normally, insulin binding to its receptor initiates a cascade of events, including phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS), activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and subsequent activation of Akt, leading to glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the cell membrane and glucose uptake. In insulin resistance, several factors disrupt this pathway. Elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) activate protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, which phosphorylate IRS-1 at serine residues, inhibiting its tyrosine phosphorylation and disrupting downstream signaling. Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 activate stress kinases such as JNK and IKK\u03b2, which also phosphorylate IRS-1 at serine residues. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, induced by nutrient excess and oxidative stress, activates unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways that impair insulin signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced oxidative capacity lead to accumulation of lipid intermediates like diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide, which activate PKC and inhibit insulin signaling. Additionally, dysregulation of phosphatases such as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) can dephosphorylate and inactivate the insulin receptor and IRS-1. These converging pathways impair insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, contributing to hyperglycemia and the development of type 2 diabetes. Therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting these pathways, such as improving mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting PKC, are under investigation."}]}]}

Each miRNA can target hundreds of different mRNAs, and conversely, each mRNA can be targeted by multiple miRNAs, creating a complex regulatory network. MiRNAs are involved in virtually all cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune response. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are ncRNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein-coding potential. LncRNAs regulate gene expression through diverse mechanisms, including chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional processing, and translational control. They can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific genomic locations, as decoys, sequestering transcription factors or miRNAs, or as signals, recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes.

It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against various diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infection. Several signaling pathways regulate autophagy, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and the PI3K\/Akt\/Beclin 1 pathway. The mTOR pathway is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Activation of mTOR inhibits autophagy, while inhibition of mTOR induces autophagy. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, is a widely used tool to induce autophagy. The AMPK pathway is activated by energy stress and promotes autophagy by inhibiting mTOR and activating ULK1, a key protein in the autophagy initiation complex. The PI3K\/Akt\/Beclin 1 pathway regulates the formation of autophagosomes, the double-membrane vesicles that engulf cytoplasmic cargo for degradation. Activation of PI3K and Akt inhibits Beclin 1, suppressing autophagy. Targeting these signaling pathways represents a promising therapeutic strategy for various diseases. For example, inducing autophagy with rapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors has shown promise in cancer therapy by promoting the degradation of damaged organelles and inhibiting tumor growth. Activating autophagy with AMPK activators has been shown to protect against neurodegenerative diseases by clearing misfolded proteins and improving neuronal survival.

This provides ATP and metabolic intermediates for biosynthesis. (2) Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP): The PPP generates NADPH, which is essential for reducing oxidative stress and synthesizing lipids and nucleotides.

DNA methylation, primarily occurring at cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides, is often globally reduced in cancer cells but shows increased methylation at specific loci, such as the promoters of tumor suppressor genes like p16INK4a, MLH1, and BRCA1. Histone modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, also influence chromatin structure and gene transcription. For example, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression, while histone acetyltransferases (HATs) promote gene expression. Alterations in histone methylation patterns, such as the loss of H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 marks, can also contribute to oncogenesis.

Mutations or epigenetic silencing of pro-apoptotic genes (e.g., BAX, BAK, TP53) or overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-XL) disrupt the balance between cell survival and death signals. Upregulation of survival signaling pathways, such as PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR and NF-\u03baB, promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis. Loss of expression or function of death receptors (e.g., FAS, TRAIL receptors) or their downstream signaling adaptors (e.g., FADD) impairs the initiation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Cancer cells can also downregulate caspases, the effector proteases that execute the apoptotic program, or express inhibitors of caspases (IAPs). Furthermore, alterations in cellular metabolism, such as increased glycolysis (Warburg effect), can provide cancer cells with a survival advantage and protect them from apoptosis. Resistance to apoptosis is a major obstacle to effective cancer therapy, and strategies to overcome apoptosis resistance, such as BH3 mimetics and SMAC mimetics, are being actively investigated."}]}]}

The microbiome also educates the immune system by presenting antigens to immune cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), promoting tolerance to commensal bacteria and preventing excessive inflammation. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiome, can disrupt these interactions and contribute to immune dysregulation and autoimmune diseases. Therapeutic interventions targeting the gut microbiome include fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications. FMT has shown promise in treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection and is being investigated for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic disorders.

In its normal state, KRAS cycles between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form, regulating downstream signaling cascades. Mutations in KRAS, particularly at codons 12, 13, or 61, often result in a constitutively active GTP-bound form that is insensitive to GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). This means that the mutated KRAS remains permanently switched 'on,' continuously stimulating downstream signaling pathways even in the absence of upstream growth factor signals. The persistently activated KRAS then activates multiple downstream effectors, including the RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK pathway, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and the Ral-GDS pathway. These pathways promote cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. Additionally, activated KRAS can induce the production of growth factors and cytokines, further stimulating cell proliferation and survival in an autocrine and paracrine manner. The constitutive activation of these downstream pathways overrides normal regulatory mechanisms, contributing to the malignant phenotype of cancer cells."}]}]}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately 22 nucleotide) ncRNAs that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. MiRNAs can act as both tumor suppressors and oncogenes depending on their target genes. For example, some miRNAs can suppress metastasis by targeting genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and invasion. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are ncRNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that regulate gene expression through diverse mechanisms. LncRNAs can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific DNA loci, or as decoys, sequestering proteins away from their target sites. They can also regulate gene transcription by interacting with chromatin-modifying enzymes or by influencing mRNA splicing and stability. In cancer metastasis, lncRNAs can promote EMT, angiogenesis, and immune evasion.

A\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase. Mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes, which encode components of the \u03b3-secretase complex, increase A\u03b2 production and are associated with early-onset familial AD. A\u03b2 oligomers are particularly neurotoxic, disrupting synaptic plasticity and inducing oxidative stress. Hyperphosphorylated tau protein detaches from microtubules, forming insoluble aggregates that impair axonal transport and neuronal function. The spread of tau pathology follows a stereotypical pattern through interconnected brain regions, suggesting a prion-like mechanism of propagation. Neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia and astrocytes, contributes to neuronal damage by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, including APOE4, which modulates A\u03b2 clearance and aggregation.

The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 delivers an inhibitory signal to T cells, suppressing their activation and effector function. This interaction is a key mechanism by which tumors evade immune surveillance. PD-L1 expression is often upregulated in tumors, either constitutively or in response to inflammatory signals in the tumor microenvironment.

This leads to the generation of viral variants that can escape recognition by antibodies and T cells. (2) Glycosylation of viral proteins: HIV's envelope glycoprotein, gp120, is heavily glycosylated, which shields it from antibody neutralization. The glycans on gp120 mask the underlying protein surface, making it difficult for antibodies to bind and neutralize the virus.

PD-1 is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and NK cells, while PD-L1 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells, as well as many cancer cells. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 delivers an inhibitory signal to T cells, suppressing their activation, proliferation, and effector functions. Cancer cells exploit this pathway to evade immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 expression, thereby inhibiting antitumor T-cell responses. Immunotherapies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 block this interaction, releasing the brakes on T cells and restoring their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. Anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 antibodies enhance T-cell activation, increase the production of cytotoxic cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and promote the infiltration of T cells into the tumor microenvironment. The efficacy of PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade depends on the presence of pre-existing antitumor immunity, as well as the level of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. However, responses can also occur in patients with low PD-L1 expression, suggesting that other factors, such as tumor mutational burden and immune cell infiltration, also play a role."}]}]}

A key feature of this metabolic reprogramming is the Warburg effect, where cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis for energy production, even in the presence of oxygen. This is in contrast to normal cells, which primarily use oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondria for energy production. The Warburg effect provides cancer cells with several advantages, including increased production of glycolytic intermediates that can be used for biosynthesis of macromolecules, such as nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. Cancer cells also increase the expression of glucose transporters, such as GLUT1, to enhance glucose uptake. In addition to the Warburg effect, cancer cells often exhibit increased glutamine metabolism. Glutamine is a major source of carbon and nitrogen for biosynthesis, and it can be converted to glutamate, which is then converted to alpha-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the Krebs cycle. Cancer cells also alter their lipid metabolism, with increased de novo lipogenesis and uptake of lipids from the microenvironment. These changes in lipid metabolism provide cancer cells with the building blocks for cell membranes and signaling molecules. Oncogenes, such as MYC and HIF-1\u03b1, and tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, play a critical role in regulating metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells.

CTLs kill virus-infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes. Helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) recognize viral antigens presented on MHC class II molecules and provide help to B cells and CTLs by secreting cytokines.

Activation of the complement system leads to several effector functions, including opsonization, inflammation, and direct lysis of pathogens. The complement system can be activated through three pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway. The classical pathway is activated by the binding of C1q to antibody-antigen complexes. The alternative pathway is activated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, leading to the deposition of C3b on microbial surfaces. The lectin pathway is activated by the binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to mannose residues on microbial surfaces. All three pathways converge on the cleavage of C3, generating C3a and C3b. C3b opsonizes pathogens, marking them for phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. C3a and C5a are potent anaphylatoxins that recruit and activate immune cells, promoting inflammation. The terminal pathway of the complement system leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which inserts into the membranes of pathogens, causing lysis. The activity of the complement system is tightly regulated to prevent excessive tissue damage. Several regulatory proteins, such as Factor H, Factor I, and C1 inhibitor, inhibit the activation of the complement cascade. Factor H binds to C3b and promotes its inactivation by Factor I.

SSRIs selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin by blocking the serotonin transporter (SERT), preventing serotonin from being reabsorbed back into the presynaptic neuron. This leads to an increase in serotonin levels in the synapse, which enhances serotonin neurotransmission. SNRIs, on the other hand, inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine by blocking both SERT and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This results in increased levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the synapse, leading to enhanced serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. While SSRIs primarily target the serotonin system, SNRIs have a dual mechanism of action, affecting both serotonin and norepinephrine.

Disruption of these rhythms, often due to shift work, jet lag, or irregular sleep patterns, can lead to metabolic dysfunction. One key mechanism involves the misalignment between central and peripheral clocks. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus is the master circadian pacemaker, synchronizing peripheral clocks in tissues such as the liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue. When the central clock is desynchronized from environmental cues (e.g., light-dark cycles), peripheral clocks can become misaligned with the SCN, leading to impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Circadian disruption also affects hormone secretion, including cortisol, melatonin, and insulin. Irregular cortisol rhythms can promote insulin resistance and visceral fat accumulation. Melatonin, which regulates sleep and glucose homeostasis, is suppressed by light exposure at night, contributing to impaired glucose tolerance. Disrupted sleep patterns, a common consequence of circadian misalignment, can lead to increased food intake, particularly of calorie-dense foods, and decreased energy expenditure, promoting weight gain.

In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, chronic ER stress and UPR activation are implicated in neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as amyloid-beta, tau, alpha-synuclein, and mutant huntingtin, triggers the UPR signaling pathways, including PERK, ATF6, and IRE1. While the UPR initially aims to restore ER homeostasis by increasing protein folding capacity and reducing protein synthesis, prolonged activation can lead to maladaptive responses. Sustained PERK activation phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, inhibiting global protein synthesis and contributing to synaptic dysfunction. IRE1 activation induces the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, resulting in the expression of XBP1s, a transcription factor that upregulates genes involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). However, chronic IRE1 activation can also trigger inflammatory signaling and apoptosis. Furthermore, the UPR can interact with other cellular stress pathways, such as autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, to coordinate protein degradation and clearance. Dysregulation of these processes contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, making the UPR a potential therapeutic target."}]}]}

CTCs exhibit significant heterogeneity, with different subpopulations possessing varying metastatic potential. Some CTCs undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquiring mesenchymal characteristics that enhance their migratory and invasive capabilities. Technologies for detecting and characterizing CTCs include CellSearch, a FDA-cleared system for enumeration based on EpCAM capture; microfluidic devices that capture CTCs based on size or surface markers; and label-free methods that isolate CTCs based on physical properties. Single-cell sequencing of CTCs allows for detailed analysis of their genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles, providing insights into their metastatic potential and drug resistance mechanisms.

However, they differ in their targeting mechanisms, ease of use, and specificity. ZFNs and TALENs rely on protein-DNA interactions for target recognition. ZFNs use zinc finger domains, each recognizing a specific 3-bp DNA sequence, while TALENs use TAL effector domains, each recognizing a single DNA base. Designing ZFNs and TALENs to target a specific sequence is complex and time-consuming, as it requires engineering proteins with the desired DNA-binding specificities. In contrast, CRISPR-Cas9 uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific DNA sequence. The gRNA is a short RNA molecule that is complementary to the target DNA sequence, making CRISPR-Cas9 much easier to design and implement. CRISPR-Cas9 is also more versatile, as it can be used to target virtually any DNA sequence simply by changing the gRNA sequence. However, CRISPR-Cas9 is also prone to off-target effects, where the Cas9 nuclease cleaves DNA at unintended sites with similar sequences to the target. ZFNs and TALENs are generally considered to have higher specificity than CRISPR-Cas9, but they are more difficult to use.

The major pathological hallmarks of AD include amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid plaques are extracellular deposits composed primarily of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides, which are generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase. The accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides, particularly A\u03b242, is thought to initiate a cascade of events that lead to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. A\u03b2 oligomers are particularly toxic to neurons, disrupting synaptic function, impairing neuronal signaling, and inducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Neurofibrillary tangles are intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein that normally stabilizes microtubules in neurons. Hyperphosphorylation of tau causes it to detach from microtubules and aggregate into paired helical filaments (PHFs), which form neurofibrillary tangles. The accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles disrupts microtubule function, impairing axonal transport and leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. Neuroinflammation also plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. Activated microglia and astrocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to neuronal damage and exacerbate the disease. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, increase the production of A\u03b2 peptides and increase the risk of developing early-onset AD. The APOE4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, influencing A\u03b2 clearance and aggregation. These mechanisms contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD through a complex interplay of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and genetic factors. Therapies aimed at reducing A\u03b2 production or aggregation, preventing tau hyperphosphorylation, or modulating neuroinflammation are being developed to slow down the progression of AD."}]}]}

KRAS is a small GTPase that functions as a molecular switch in the EGFR\/MAPK signaling pathway. In its normal state, KRAS cycles between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form, regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Oncogenic KRAS mutations impair the intrinsic GTPase activity of the protein, preventing it from returning to the inactive GDP-bound state. This leads to continuous activation of downstream effectors, including the RAF\/MEK\/ERK and PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathways, promoting cell growth, survival, and metastasis. Targeting mutant KRAS has been a long-standing challenge due to several factors. First, KRAS lacks a deep binding pocket for small molecule inhibitors, making it difficult to directly inhibit its activity. Second, KRAS has a high affinity for GTP, further hindering the development of competitive inhibitors. Third, KRAS is localized to the cell membrane, requiring inhibitors to be able to access this location. Recent advances have led to the development of KRAS G12C inhibitors, which covalently bind to the cysteine residue at position 12 in the G12C mutant KRAS protein, locking it in an inactive GDP-bound state. These inhibitors have shown promising clinical activity in tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation.

Following a DSB, cells primarily employ two major DNA repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ is an error-prone pathway that directly ligates the broken DNA ends, often resulting in small insertions or deletions (indels) that can disrupt gene function, commonly used for gene knockout strategies. HDR, on the other hand, utilizes a provided DNA template with homology to the regions flanking the DSB to precisely repair the break, enabling targeted gene insertion or correction. Factors influencing the choice between NHEJ and HDR include cell cycle stage, with HDR being more active in S and G2 phases when a sister chromatid is available as a template. The relative efficiency of HDR can be improved by co-delivery of a repair template and by transiently inhibiting NHEJ components such as DNA ligase IV or Ku proteins. Off-target effects can occur if the gRNA has sufficient homology to other genomic sites, leading to unintended DSBs and potential mutations.

PD-1 is expressed on T cells and binds to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed on tumor cells and immune cells, leading to T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. By blocking these checkpoints with monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors enhance T cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Checkpoint inhibitor therapies have shown remarkable success in treating various types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and bladder cancer.

Wild-type KRAS functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state upon growth factor stimulation. GTP hydrolysis inactivates KRAS, allowing for regulated signaling. However, oncogenic KRAS mutations impair GTP hydrolysis, locking KRAS in its active GTP-bound form. This leads to continuous activation of downstream signaling pathways such as the MAPK (ERK) and PI3K\/AKT pathways, which promote cell cycle progression, inhibit apoptosis, and enhance cell migration. Furthermore, mutant KRAS can induce changes in the tumor microenvironment by stimulating angiogenesis and modulating immune cell infiltration. In colorectal cancer, KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies like cetuximab and panitumumab because the constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the need for upstream EGFR signaling. The specific KRAS mutation can also influence sensitivity to downstream inhibitors, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies based on KRAS genotype.

These mechanisms include enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, alteration of the antibiotic target, decreased antibiotic uptake, and increased antibiotic efflux. Enzymatic inactivation involves the production of enzymes, such as beta-lactamases, that degrade or modify antibiotics, rendering them inactive. Alteration of the antibiotic target involves mutations in the bacterial protein or RNA that the antibiotic binds to, reducing its affinity and effectiveness. Decreased antibiotic uptake can occur through mutations in porins or other membrane transport proteins, limiting the entry of antibiotics into the bacterial cell. Increased antibiotic efflux involves the overexpression of efflux pumps that actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, reducing their intracellular concentration. Bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer, including conjugation, transduction, and transformation.

The TME consists of various cellular and non-cellular components, including fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor invasion by remodeling the ECM, secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the basement membrane, and providing physical support for tumor cell migration. Immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), can either promote or suppress metastasis depending on their polarization state and the specific cytokines they secrete. Endothelial cells contribute to angiogenesis, providing new blood vessels that facilitate tumor cell intravasation and dissemination. The ECM provides a structural scaffold for the TME and influences cell adhesion, migration, and survival. Growth factors and cytokines, such as VEGF, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-6, promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune suppression. Chemokines, such as CCL2 and CXCL12, recruit immune cells and tumor cells to specific sites. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell-cell adhesion and gain mesenchymal characteristics, enabling them to invade and metastasize.

Hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions can repress the transcription of tumor suppressor genes, while hypomethylation of oncogenes can lead to their overexpression. Histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, alter chromatin structure and accessibility, influencing gene transcription. Histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes gene expression by relaxing chromatin structure, while histone deacetylation, mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), leads to chromatin condensation and gene silencing.

It consists of two main components: the Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a molecular scissor, and a guide RNA (gRNA), which directs Cas9 to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The gRNA is a synthetic RNA molecule that contains a 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA sequence, followed by a scaffold sequence that binds to the Cas9 protein. Once the gRNA guides Cas9 to the target DNA sequence, Cas9 cleaves both strands of the DNA, creating a double-strand break (DSB). The cell then attempts to repair the DSB through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can lead to insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt gene function, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which requires a DNA template to repair the break and can be used to introduce specific gene edits. CRISPR-Cas9 has numerous potential applications in biomedical research, including gene knockout, gene knock-in, gene correction, gene regulation, and genome-wide screening.

Autophagy is regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including mTOR, AMPK, and Beclin-1. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, autophagy is often impaired, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates, such as amyloid-beta plaques, alpha-synuclein Lewy bodies, and mutant huntingtin protein, respectively. These aggregates can disrupt neuronal function and contribute to neuronal death. Enhancing autophagy has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. This can be achieved through pharmacological interventions, such as mTOR inhibitors (e.g., rapamycin) or autophagy-inducing peptides, or through genetic manipulation to increase the expression of autophagy-related genes.

The most common activating mutations in EGFR are deletions in exon 19 (e.g., delE746-A750) and the L858R point mutation in exon 21. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, resulting in increased cell proliferation, survival, and tumor growth. EGFR TKIs, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, are designed to specifically inhibit the activity of mutant EGFR, leading to tumor regression in many patients. However, resistance to EGFR TKIs inevitably develops over time, limiting their long-term efficacy. Several mechanisms contribute to EGFR TKI resistance: 1) Secondary mutations: The most common mechanism of resistance is the development of the T790M mutation in exon 20 of EGFR. This mutation increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP, making it less sensitive to TKIs. 2) Bypass signaling pathways: Activation of alternative signaling pathways, such as MET amplification, HER2 amplification, or PI3K\/AKT activation, can bypass the dependence on EGFR signaling and confer resistance to TKIs. 3) Phenotypic transformation: Transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can lead to loss of EGFR dependence and resistance to TKIs. 4) Histological transformation: Development of squamous cell carcinoma. 5) Downstream mutations: Mutations in genes downstream of EGFR, such as BRAF, can also lead to resistance. Overcoming EGFR TKI resistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Strategies to overcome resistance include the development of third-generation EGFR TKIs (e.g., osimertinib) that are active against T790M-mutant EGFR, combination therapies targeting multiple signaling pathways, and the use of immunotherapy."}]}]}

At the cellular level, insulin resistance is characterized by impaired insulin signaling in target tissues, primarily skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Several mechanisms contribute to this impaired signaling. One key factor is the accumulation of intracellular lipids, particularly diacylglycerols (DAGs) and ceramides, which activate serine kinases that phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at inhibitory serine residues, thereby blocking downstream signaling. Chronic inflammation, triggered by obesity and macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue, also plays a critical role. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 activate signaling pathways that interfere with insulin signaling. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, caused by nutrient overload and impaired protein folding, activates stress kinases that also inhibit IRS-1. In skeletal muscle, impaired glucose transport due to reduced expression and translocation of GLUT4, the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter, contributes to insulin resistance. In the liver, insulin resistance leads to impaired suppression of hepatic glucose production, resulting in hyperglycemia. Adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by increased lipolysis and release of free fatty acids, further exacerbates insulin resistance in other tissues. Genetic factors also influence insulin sensitivity by affecting insulin receptor expression, signaling protein function, and mitochondrial function.

When CFTR function is impaired, mucus becomes thick and sticky, leading to chronic lung infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and other complications. CFTR mutations are classified into six classes based on their impact on protein synthesis, processing, and function. Class I mutations result in defective protein production, leading to little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface. Class II mutations, such as the most common mutation \u0394F508, cause defective protein processing, resulting in misfolding and degradation of the protein. Class III mutations affect channel regulation, preventing the channel from opening properly. Class IV mutations alter channel conductance, reducing the flow of chloride ions.

Additionally, HIV downregulates MHC class I expression on infected cells, reducing their visibility to CTLs. HIV also produces proteins, such as Nef and Vpu, that interfere with cellular antiviral mechanisms. Influenza virus, on the other hand, undergoes frequent antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift involves the accumulation of point mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes, leading to gradual changes in the viral surface antigens. Antigenic shift involves the reassortment of viral gene segments between different influenza strains, resulting in the emergence of novel viruses with drastically altered surface antigens. These antigenic variations allow influenza viruses to evade pre-existing immunity in the population. Influenza viruses also produce proteins, such as NS1, that interfere with interferon signaling, thereby suppressing the host's antiviral responses.

Certain bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved efficacy of ICIs in various cancers [PMID: 29075149]. These bacteria can enhance antitumor immunity by modulating dendritic cell maturation, increasing T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and promoting the production of immunostimulatory cytokines. Conversely, dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiome, can impair the response to ICIs. Factors such as antibiotic use, diet, and underlying medical conditions can disrupt the gut microbiome composition and diversity, leading to decreased efficacy of ICIs and increased risk of immune-related adverse events. The mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences ICI efficacy are complex and multifactorial. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can modulate immune cell function and promote antitumor immunity. SCFAs like butyrate and propionate can enhance T-cell activity and suppress regulatory T-cell function. The composition of the gut microbiome also influences the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, on immune cells. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being explored as potential approaches to enhance the efficacy of ICIs and overcome resistance."}]}]}

Mutations in these genes impair HR, leading to genomic instability and increased susceptibility to cancer, particularly breast and ovarian cancer. Cells with BRCA1\/2 mutations rely on alternative DNA repair pathways, such as base excision repair (BER) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), to maintain genomic integrity. PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) enzymes are involved in BER, and they play a critical role in repairing single-strand DNA breaks. PARP inhibitors block PARP activity, leading to the accumulation of single-strand breaks that are converted to double-strand breaks during DNA replication. In cells with functional HR (BRCA1\/2 proficient), these double-strand breaks can be repaired efficiently. However, in cells with BRCA1\/2 mutations, the double-strand breaks cannot be repaired properly, leading to genomic instability, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately cell death. This synthetic lethality principle underlies the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in treating BRCA-mutant cancers. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, rucaparib, and talazoparib, have shown significant clinical benefit in patients with BRCA-mutant ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers [PMID: 24848028]."}]}]}

The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions, enabling tumor cells to evade immune destruction. Specifically, PD-1 engagement recruits phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling complex, inhibiting downstream signaling pathways required for T cell activation. This results in decreased production of cytokines like IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, reduced cytotoxic activity, and impaired T cell migration to the tumor site. Furthermore, PD-1 signaling can induce T cell exhaustion, characterized by loss of effector functions and increased expression of inhibitory receptors. By blocking the PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction with monoclonal antibodies, these inhibitory signals are disrupted, restoring T cell activity and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. This blockade promotes T cell proliferation, increases cytokine production, and enhances cytotoxic killing of tumor cells. In addition, PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade can reverse T cell exhaustion, allowing exhausted T cells to regain their effector functions and contribute to tumor regression. The effectiveness of PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors depends on the presence of pre-existing anti-tumor T cell responses and the level of PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapies targeting other immune checkpoints or co-stimulatory molecules are being explored to further enhance the efficacy of PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade."}]}]}

DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands, often leads to gene silencing by recruiting methyl-binding proteins and compacting chromatin. Histone modifications, such as acetylation (associated with active transcription) and methylation (can be either activating or repressive depending on the specific lysine residue modified), alter chromatin structure and accessibility to transcription factors. Non-coding RNAs, like microRNAs, can regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA and inhibiting translation or promoting mRNA degradation. During development, these epigenetic marks are dynamically remodeled to establish cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, driving cellular differentiation and maintaining cell identity. Aberrant epigenetic modifications can contribute to developmental disorders and cancer by disrupting normal gene regulation [PMID: 17008851]."}]}]}

In cancer metastasis, EVs play a crucial role in preparing the pre-metastatic niche, promoting angiogenesis, and facilitating immune evasion. Cancer-derived EVs can transfer matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases to recipient cells, degrading the extracellular matrix and promoting cancer cell invasion. They can also deliver pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to endothelial cells, stimulating new blood vessel formation and supporting tumor growth. EVs can modulate the immune system by transferring immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, to immune cells, inhibiting their anti-tumor activity. Additionally, EVs can deliver microRNAs that alter gene expression in recipient cells, promoting cancer cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Understanding the mechanisms by which EVs mediate intercellular communication in cancer metastasis is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies that target EV biogenesis, trafficking, or uptake."}]}]}

In cancer cells, RTKs are often overexpressed or mutated, leading to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways that drive tumorigenesis. The major pathways activated by RTKs include the RAS\/MAPK pathway, the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, and the JAK\/STAT pathway. The RAS\/MAPK pathway regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Activation of RAS by RTKs leads to activation of downstream kinases, including RAF, MEK, and ERK, which ultimately activate transcription factors that promote cell cycle progression. The PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway regulates cell survival, growth, and metabolism. Activation of PI3K by RTKs leads to activation of AKT, which phosphorylates and inhibits pro-apoptotic proteins, promoting cell survival. AKT also activates mTOR, which stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth. The JAK\/STAT pathway regulates inflammation and immune responses. Activation of JAKs by RTKs leads to phosphorylation and activation of STATs, which translocate to the nucleus and regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. Aberrant activation of these pathways promotes uncontrolled cell growth, inhibits apoptosis, and enhances angiogenesis, all of which contribute to tumorigenesis. Targeted therapies that inhibit these pathways have shown efficacy in treating certain cancers."}]}]}

Enzymatic inactivation involves bacterial enzymes that degrade or modify antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Examples include \u03b2-lactamases that hydrolyze \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Target modification involves mutations in the bacterial target site that reduce the antibiotic's affinity. For example, mutations in the ribosome can confer resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines. Efflux pumps actively transport antibiotics out of the bacterial cell, reducing their intracellular concentration. Overexpression of efflux pumps can confer resistance to multiple antibiotics. Reduced permeability involves changes in the bacterial cell wall or outer membrane that decrease antibiotic entry. Mutations in porin channels can restrict the entry of antibiotics into Gram-negative bacteria. Horizontal gene transfer, including plasmids, transposons, and integrons, plays a crucial role in the spread of resistance genes among bacteria. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing new antibiotics and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance."}]}]}

Disruption of circadian rhythms, through factors such as shift work, jet lag, or genetic mutations in clock genes, can lead to metabolic disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The molecular clock regulates the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in various tissues, including the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. For example, the clock genes PER2 and CRY1 regulate hepatic glucose production, while BMAL1 and CLOCK influence insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. Circadian misalignment can disrupt glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism, leading to metabolic dysfunction.

Some viruses undergo rapid mutation, generating antigenic variants that evade antibody recognition. Others establish latency, hiding within host cells and evading immune surveillance. Strategies to develop effective antiviral therapies include targeting viral enzymes required for replication (e.g., reverse transcriptase inhibitors for HIV), blocking viral entry into host cells (e.g., fusion inhibitors for HIV), inhibiting viral assembly or release, and boosting the host immune response (e.g., IFN-based therapies).

Firstly, inflammatory cells release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS\/RNS) that induce DNA damage, increasing the mutation rate in nearby cells.

These cytokines also enhance angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF, supplying tumors with nutrients and oxygen. Furthermore, chronic inflammation disrupts normal tissue architecture and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), facilitating tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), released by inflammatory cells, degrade the extracellular matrix, enabling tumor cells to migrate to distant sites. Finally, inflammation suppresses the adaptive immune response by recruiting immunosuppressive cells like myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which inhibit cytotoxic T cell activity and promote immune evasion. Together, these processes create a permissive microenvironment that supports tumor initiation, growth, and dissemination."}]}]}

Amyloid plaques are formed by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides, which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase. A\u03b2 peptides, particularly A\u03b242, are prone to aggregation, forming oligomers and fibrils that deposit as plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules. In AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, leading to its detachment from microtubules and aggregation into paired helical filaments that form tangles. The accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles leads to neuronal dysfunction, synaptic loss, and neuronal death, ultimately resulting in cognitive decline. Other molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis include inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired clearance of A\u03b2 and tau. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), can increase A\u03b2 production and increase the risk of early-onset AD.
