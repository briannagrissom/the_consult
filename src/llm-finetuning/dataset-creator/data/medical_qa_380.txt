    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR gene lead to oncogenesis and what are the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Activating mutations in EGFR, such as deletions in exon 19 or the L858R point mutation in exon 21, result in constitutive activation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, leading to downstream activation of the Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs commonly arises through the acquisition of the T790M mutation in EGFR, which sterically hinders drug binding. Other resistance mechanisms include activation of bypass pathways such as MET amplification, BRAF mutations, or PIK3CA mutations, as well as histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer. Third-generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib are designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance, but resistance to these agents can develop through mutations such as C797S, or through bypass pathway activation and histologic transformation.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in IBD pathogenesis through complex interactions with the host immune system and intestinal barrier function. In genetically susceptible individuals, dysbiosis—characterized by decreased microbial diversity, reduced abundance of beneficial commensals (e.g., Firmicutes), and enrichment of pathobionts (e.g., adherent-invasive E. coli)—can disrupt immune homeostasis and trigger chronic intestinal inflammation. Dysbiosis promotes increased intestinal permeability, allowing microbial products like LPS to activate innate immune receptors such as TLRs and NOD2. This leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that amplify the inflammatory cascade. Furthermore, altered microbial metabolism can result in decreased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which normally promote intestinal barrier integrity and suppress inflammation. Specific microbial species and metabolites can also directly activate or inhibit immune cells, influencing the balance between pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 responses and regulatory T-cell activity. Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, aim to restore microbial diversity and promote a more balanced and anti-inflammatory microbial composition.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors work to enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, block inhibitory signaling pathways that normally suppress T-cell activation and effector function. CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, competes with the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thereby inhibiting T-cell activation during the priming phase in lymph nodes. PD-1, also expressed on T cells, binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are often upregulated on tumor cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction delivers an inhibitory signal that promotes T-cell exhaustion, apoptosis, and reduced cytokine production. By blocking these checkpoint pathways, checkpoint inhibitors unleash T-cell responses against tumor cells, leading to tumor regression in some patients. However, not all patients respond to checkpoint inhibitors, and mechanisms of resistance include lack of pre-existing T-cell infiltration into the tumor, defects in antigen presentation, and upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints.",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. Amyloid-beta plaques are formed by the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides, which are produced by the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules within neurons. In AD, hyperphosphorylation of tau causes it to detach from microtubules and aggregate into insoluble tangles. Amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles disrupt neuronal function, trigger inflammatory responses, and ultimately lead to neuronal death. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), increase amyloid-beta production and the risk of early-onset AD. The APOE4 allele is also a major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, influencing amyloid-beta clearance and aggregation. Other factors, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired glucose metabolism, contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system, and what strategies are being developed to overcome viral immune evasion?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade the host immune system, enabling them to establish persistent infections. These mechanisms include: (1) Interference with interferon (IFN) signaling: Many viruses encode proteins that inhibit the production or signaling of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β), which are crucial for antiviral defense. (2) Inhibition of antigen presentation: Viruses can block the processing and presentation of viral antigens on MHC class I molecules, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). (3) Evasion of antibody responses: Some viruses undergo rapid antigenic variation through mutations in their surface glycoproteins, allowing them to escape neutralization by pre-existing antibodies. (4) Suppression of apoptosis: Viruses can express proteins that inhibit apoptosis, preventing infected cells from undergoing programmed cell death. (5) Latency: Some viruses establish a latent state in which they minimize viral gene expression, making them less susceptible to immune detection. Strategies to overcome viral immune evasion include: (1) Development of vaccines that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies and robust T-cell responses. (2) Use of immunostimulatory agents, such as TLR agonists and STING activators, to enhance innate and adaptive immunity. (3) Engineering of T cells with enhanced affinity for viral antigens or resistance to immune suppression. (4) Development of antiviral drugs that target viral proteins involved in immune evasion.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy, and what approaches can be used to overcome this resistance?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy through multiple mechanisms, including: (1) Increased drug efflux: Overexpression of drug efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), transports chemotherapeutic agents out of cancer cells, reducing their intracellular concentration. (2) Decreased drug uptake: Reduced expression of drug transporters can limit the entry of chemotherapeutic agents into cancer cells. (3) Altered drug metabolism: Cancer cells can metabolize chemotherapeutic agents into inactive forms, reducing their cytotoxic activity. (4) Target alterations: Mutations in the drug target can reduce drug binding affinity or efficacy. (5) DNA repair: Increased DNA repair capacity allows cancer cells to repair DNA damage induced by chemotherapeutic agents. (6) Apoptosis resistance: Cancer cells can develop resistance to apoptosis, preventing chemotherapeutic agents from triggering programmed cell death. (7) Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT): EMT promotes chemoresistance by altering cell morphology and increasing cell motility. Approaches to overcome chemoresistance include: (1) Development of drugs that inhibit drug efflux pumps. (2) Use of combination therapies that target multiple resistance mechanisms. (3) Development of targeted therapies that selectively kill chemoresistant cells. (4) Use of immunotherapy to enhance the immune system's ability to eliminate chemoresistant cells.

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) that are secreted by cells and mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA) to recipient cells. In cancer, exosomes play a crucial role in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes can transfer oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to neighboring cells, promoting their malignant transformation. They can also stimulate angiogenesis by delivering pro-angiogenic factors to endothelial cells. Exosomes can suppress immune responses by delivering immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells, such as T cells and dendritic cells. In metastasis, exosomes can prepare the pre-metastatic niche by delivering factors that promote angiogenesis, immune suppression, and extracellular matrix remodeling in distant organs. Tumor cells can also use exosomes to transfer drug resistance factors to other cancer cells, promoting chemoresistance. Exosomes are being explored as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.",

    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work, and what are its potential applications in treating genetic diseases?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9) is a revolutionary gene editing technology derived from the adaptive immune system of bacteria. It consists of two key components: the Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a molecular scissor, and a guide RNA (gRNA), which directs Cas9 to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The gRNA is a short RNA molecule that is complementary to the target DNA sequence. When the gRNA binds to the target DNA sequence, Cas9 makes a double-stranded break at that site. The cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms then repair the break, either through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which can introduce insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt gene function, or through homology-directed repair (HDR), which can be used to insert a new DNA sequence into the break site. Potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in treating genetic diseases include: (1) Gene knockout: Disrupting the function of a disease-causing gene. (2) Gene correction: Correcting a mutated gene by replacing it with a healthy copy. (3) Gene insertion: Inserting a therapeutic gene into a specific location in the genome. (4) Epigenetic editing: Modifying gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promise in treating various genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington's disease, but further research is needed to optimize its safety and efficacy.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, and how are they targeted by anticancer drugs?",
    "answer": "Several major signaling pathways are frequently dysregulated in cancer cells, promoting uncontrolled cell growth, survival, and metastasis. These include: (1) Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways: RTKs, such as EGFR, HER2, and VEGFR, activate downstream signaling cascades like Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and JAK/STAT, which regulate cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Targeted therapies that inhibit RTKs, such as gefitinib, trastuzumab, and bevacizumab, have shown significant clinical benefits in various cancers. (2) PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: This pathway is frequently activated in cancer cells due to mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, or AKT. mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, are used to treat some cancers. (3) Ras/MAPK pathway: Mutations in Ras or BRAF are common in cancer, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, have shown remarkable efficacy in treating melanoma with BRAF mutations. (4) Wnt/β-catenin pathway: This pathway is involved in cell fate determination and tissue development. Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway is implicated in colon cancer and other malignancies. (5) p53 pathway: p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated or inactivated in cancer cells. Restoring p53 function is a major goal in cancer therapy. (6) Cell cycle regulators: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate cell cycle progression. CDK inhibitors, such as palbociclib, are used to treat breast cancer.",

  {
    "question": "How does the tumor microenvironment influence cancer progression and response to therapy?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem surrounding cancer cells, comprising stromal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells), extracellular matrix (ECM), growth factors, cytokines, and metabolites. The TME plays a critical role in cancer progression, metastasis, and response to therapy. Stromal cells in the TME can promote tumor growth by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and ECM components. Endothelial cells in the TME support angiogenesis, providing nutrients and oxygen to the tumor. Immune cells in the TME can either promote or suppress tumor growth, depending on their phenotype and activation state. The ECM provides structural support to the tumor and can influence cell migration, invasion, and drug delivery. Hypoxia and acidosis in the TME can promote tumor cell survival and resistance to therapy. The TME can also influence the response to immunotherapy by modulating immune cell infiltration and function. Targeting the TME is a promising strategy to improve cancer therapy. Strategies to target the TME include: (1) Anti-angiogenic therapy: Inhibiting angiogenesis to starve the tumor. (2) Stromal cell depletion: Eliminating stromal cells that support tumor growth. (3) Immunomodulation: Enhancing anti-tumor immunity. (4) ECM remodeling: Modifying the ECM to improve drug delivery and reduce tumor stiffness.",
