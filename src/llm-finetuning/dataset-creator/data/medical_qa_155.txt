    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development of atherosclerosis?",
    "answer": "Chronic inflammation plays a central role in all stages of atherogenesis. Initially, endothelial dysfunction caused by factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or smoking increases endothelial permeability and leukocyte adhesion. Monocytes and T lymphocytes infiltrate the subendothelial space, where monocytes differentiate into macrophages. Macrophages engulf oxidized LDL cholesterol, transforming into foam cells, the hallmark of early lesions. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) produced by macrophages and T cells further amplify endothelial activation and recruit more immune cells. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released by macrophages degrade the extracellular matrix, destabilizing the plaque. Advanced lesions are characterized by a necrotic core rich in lipids and cellular debris. Plaque rupture or erosion triggers thrombosis, leading to acute coronary syndromes or stroke. Systemic inflammatory markers like CRP and IL-6 are independent predictors of cardiovascular events, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory burden. Therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation, such as statins and colchicine, have demonstrated benefits in reducing cardiovascular risk, highlighting the importance of inflammation as a therapeutic target [PMID: 29301987].",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms by which metformin exerts its anti-hyperglycemic effects?",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. This effect is mediated in part through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. AMPK activation inhibits gluconeogenic enzymes, such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), thereby reducing hepatic glucose output. Metformin also enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle, by increasing glucose uptake and utilization. This involves translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell membrane. Additionally, metformin improves gut microbiota composition, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria that promote glucose metabolism and reduce inflammation. Metformin also affects mitochondrial function by inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain, which leads to decreased ATP production and increased AMP/ATP ratio, further activating AMPK. Recent studies also suggest that metformin may exert anti-hyperglycemic effects through incretin-dependent pathways, enhancing the secretion of GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells. The multifaceted mechanisms of action of metformin contribute to its efficacy as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes [PMID: 29694590].",

    "question": "How do immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) work by blocking inhibitory signals that prevent T cells from effectively attacking cancer cells. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are key immune checkpoints that downregulate T cell activity. CTLA-4, primarily expressed on T cells, competes with CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thereby inhibiting T cell activation and promoting T regulatory cell (Treg) function. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, such as ipilimumab, block this interaction, enhancing T cell priming and reducing Treg-mediated suppression. PD-1, expressed on activated T cells, binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are often upregulated on tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. This interaction inhibits T cell effector function, promotes T cell exhaustion, and induces apoptosis. Anti-PD-1 antibodies (e.g., nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and anti-PD-L1 antibodies (e.g., atezolizumab, durvalumab) block this pathway, restoring T cell activity and promoting tumor cell killing. ICIs can elicit durable responses in a subset of patients with various cancers, but they are also associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to the unleashing of systemic T cell activity. Combination strategies involving ICIs with chemotherapy, radiation, or other immunotherapies are being actively investigated to improve response rates and overcome resistance mechanisms [PMID: 26762684].",

    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes that play a critical role in DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination repair (HRR). They are involved in repairing double-strand DNA breaks, which can arise from DNA damage caused by radiation, chemicals, or normal cellular processes. Mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 impair the HRR pathway, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability. This genomic instability increases the likelihood of cells acquiring additional mutations that drive tumorigenesis. BRCA1 and BRCA2 also interact with other proteins involved in cell cycle control, DNA damage response, and transcriptional regulation. Loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function disrupts these processes, further contributing to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Cells with BRCA1/2 mutations become more reliant on alternative DNA repair pathways, such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which are error-prone and can lead to further genomic instability. The increased risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers in individuals with BRCA1/2 mutations highlights the importance of these genes in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing tumorigenesis. PARP inhibitors exploit the DNA repair deficiency in BRCA1/2-mutated cells, leading to synthetic lethality and tumor cell death [PMID: 20107424].",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the development of autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in shaping the immune system and influencing the development of autoimmune diseases through several mechanisms. The gut microbiota educates the immune system by providing a constant source of antigens that promote the development of immune tolerance. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition, can disrupt this tolerance and lead to immune dysregulation. Specific gut bacteria can promote or suppress the development of autoimmune diseases. For example, certain species, such as Bacteroides fragilis, can produce polysaccharide A (PSA), which has been shown to suppress inflammation and promote immune tolerance. Conversely, other bacteria, such as certain strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, can promote inflammation and exacerbate autoimmune responses. The gut microbiota also produces metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can influence immune cell function. SCFAs, such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate, are produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. The gut microbiota can also influence the permeability of the intestinal barrier. Dysbiosis can lead to increased intestinal permeability, or 'leaky gut,' which allows bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to enter the circulation and activate the immune system. This can trigger systemic inflammation and contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. Modulation of the gut microbiome through dietary interventions, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is being explored as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases [PMID: 29075179].",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. Amyloid plaques are primarily composed of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Mutations in APP, PSEN1 (presenilin 1), and PSEN2 (presenilin 2), which are components of the γ-secretase complex, increase Aβ production and aggregation. Aβ oligomers are neurotoxic and can trigger synaptic dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules in neurons. Hyperphosphorylation of tau causes it to detach from microtubules and aggregate into insoluble tangles. Genetic mutations in the MAPT gene, which encodes tau, can increase the risk of AD. Neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia and astrocytes, contributes to neuronal damage and disease progression. Activated microglia and astrocytes release inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which can exacerbate Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation. Genetic variants in genes involved in immune function, such as TREM2, have been associated with increased AD risk. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired glucose metabolism also contribute to neuronal vulnerability in AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are being actively investigated [PMID: 30150305].",

    "question": "How does resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) develop in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?",
    "answer": "Resistance to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC can arise through various mechanisms, broadly categorized as on-target and off-target resistance. The most common on-target resistance mechanism is the acquisition of the T790M mutation in EGFR, which sterically hinders TKI binding. Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI, is designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance. Other on-target resistance mechanisms include EGFR amplification, C797S mutations, and bypass signaling. Off-target resistance mechanisms involve activation of alternative signaling pathways that bypass EGFR inhibition. Activation of the MET pathway, either through MET amplification or MET exon 14 skipping mutations, can promote cell survival and proliferation independent of EGFR signaling. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, often through PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutations, can also bypass EGFR inhibition. Transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is another resistance mechanism, characterized by loss of RB1 and TP53 function. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can also confer resistance to EGFR TKIs by altering cell morphology and increasing invasiveness. Immunotherapy is being explored as a strategy to overcome TKI resistance by targeting immune checkpoints and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Combination strategies involving EGFR TKIs with MET inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, or chemotherapy are also under investigation [PMID: 27989697].",

    "question": "What are the main signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?",
    "answer": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis involves complex interactions of immune cells, inflammatory mediators, and signaling pathways within the synovium. Key signaling pathways include the TNF-α, IL-6, and JAK-STAT pathways. TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, activates downstream signaling cascades, leading to the production of other cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to joint inflammation and tissue damage. IL-6, another pro-inflammatory cytokine, activates the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the expression of genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis. The JAK-STAT pathway is also activated by other cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-23, and type I interferons. Activation of the NF-κB pathway, triggered by TNF-α, IL-1β, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. The MAPK pathway, including ERK, JNK, and p38, is activated by various stimuli and contributes to cytokine production and cellular stress responses. T cell activation, mediated by the TCR-CD3 complex, leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT and PLCγ pathways, which promote T cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production. Therapeutic strategies targeting these signaling pathways, such as TNF inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and T cell costimulation blockers, have revolutionized the treatment of RA [PMID: 28886922].",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to evade the host immune system, allowing them to establish persistent infections. One common strategy is to interfere with interferon (IFN) signaling, a critical antiviral defense. Many viruses encode proteins that inhibit IFN production or block downstream signaling pathways, preventing the induction of antiviral genes. Viruses can also evade detection by the immune system by downregulating the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on infected cells, which prevents recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Some viruses encode proteins that directly inhibit the proteasome, which is responsible for processing viral antigens for presentation on MHC class I molecules. Viruses can also produce decoy receptors or soluble antigens that bind to neutralizing antibodies, preventing them from targeting infected cells. Another strategy is to establish latency, where the virus remains dormant within host cells and avoids immune detection. During latency, viral gene expression is limited, and the virus does not produce antigens that would trigger an immune response. Some viruses can also actively suppress the immune system by infecting and impairing the function of immune cells, such as T cells or macrophages. For example, HIV infects CD4+ T cells and leads to their depletion, resulting in immunosuppression. Viruses can also induce the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 or TGF-β, which inhibit the activity of immune cells [PMID: 30287870].",

    "question": "How do cancer cells acquire resistance to chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy through a variety of mechanisms, often involving multiple pathways. Increased drug efflux is a common mechanism, mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (MDR1), which pump chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell. Alterations in drug metabolism, either through increased detoxification or decreased activation, can also reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy. Mutations in drug targets can render them insensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. For example, mutations in the gene encoding topoisomerase II can confer resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors. Increased DNA repair capacity allows cancer cells to repair DNA damage induced by chemotherapy, reducing its cytotoxic effect. Activation of survival signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways, can promote cell survival and protect against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can confer resistance to chemotherapy by altering cell morphology and increasing invasiveness. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem-like properties, are often resistant to chemotherapy and can contribute to tumor recurrence. The tumor microenvironment, including hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and interactions with stromal cells, can also promote chemotherapy resistance. Combination strategies involving chemotherapy with targeted therapies or immunotherapies are being actively investigated to overcome resistance mechanisms [PMID: 28216651].",
