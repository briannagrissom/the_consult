    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR gene contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, primarily in exons 18-21, lead to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways such as RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Common activating mutations like exon 19 deletions (del19) and the L858R point mutation increase the affinity of EGFR for ATP, rendering the receptor more sensitive to EGFR-TKIs like gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib. However, acquired resistance mechanisms frequently emerge, most notably the T790M mutation in exon 20, which sterically hinders TKI binding to the ATP-binding pocket. Other resistance mechanisms include MET amplification, bypass signaling activation (e.g., PI3K/AKT pathway), and histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer. Third-generation EGFR-TKIs such as osimertinib were designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by selectively and irreversibly binding to EGFR harboring both activating and T790M mutations. Additionally, C797S mutations can confer resistance to osimertinib by disrupting its covalent binding to EGFR. Newer strategies under investigation include combination therapies targeting bypass pathways, antibody-drug conjugates, and next-generation TKIs that overcome C797S and other emerging resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, liquid biopsies assessing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are used to detect resistance mutations early and guide treatment decisions.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which immunotherapy, specifically checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1, promotes anti-tumor responses?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 unleash anti-tumor immune responses by disrupting inhibitory signaling pathways that normally maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity. PD-1 is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and NK cells, while PD-L1 is expressed on various immune cells and tumor cells. Binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions, leading to T-cell exhaustion or anergy. Tumor cells exploit this pathway to evade immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 expression. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies block this interaction, reinvigorating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and enhancing their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells. This involves several mechanisms, including increased IFN-γ production, enhanced CTL-mediated cytotoxicity through perforin and granzyme release, and improved T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, checkpoint inhibition can reverse T-cell exhaustion by restoring metabolic fitness, promoting clonal expansion, and reducing the expression of inhibitory receptors. The efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade depends on pre-existing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and the presence of neoantigens that can be recognized by the immune system. Combination therapies that enhance antigen presentation, promote T-cell priming, or target other immune checkpoints (e.g., CTLA-4, LAG-3) can further augment the anti-tumor effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.",

    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis?",
    "answer": "Chronic inflammation plays a central role in all stages of atherosclerosis, from initial endothelial dysfunction to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Endothelial cells exposed to risk factors like hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking become activated and express adhesion molecules (e.g., VCAM-1, ICAM-1) that recruit monocytes and T lymphocytes from the circulation. These immune cells migrate into the subendothelial space, where monocytes differentiate into macrophages and engulf modified LDL particles, transforming into foam cells – a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions. Activated macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that further amplify endothelial activation, recruit more immune cells, and promote smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration into the intima. Cytokines also stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the extracellular matrix, destabilizing the atherosclerotic plaque. T lymphocytes, particularly Th1 cells, contribute to inflammation by secreting IFN-γ, which activates macrophages and inhibits smooth muscle cell collagen synthesis, further weakening the plaque. Advanced atherosclerotic plaques contain a necrotic core rich in lipids, cellular debris, and inflammatory mediators. Plaque rupture, triggered by mechanical stress or inflammation-induced weakening of the fibrous cap, exposes the thrombogenic core to the bloodstream, leading to platelet activation, thrombus formation, and acute ischemic events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore, targeting inflammatory pathways is a promising strategy for preventing and treating atherosclerosis.",

    "question": "What are the main mechanisms through which insulin resistance develops in type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, arises from a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and metabolic disturbances. At the cellular level, insulin resistance is characterized by impaired insulin signaling in target tissues, primarily skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Several mechanisms contribute to this impaired signaling. One key factor is the accumulation of intracellular lipids, particularly diacylglycerols (DAGs) and ceramides, which activate serine kinases that phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at inhibitory serine residues, thereby blocking downstream signaling. Chronic inflammation, triggered by obesity and macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue, also plays a critical role. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 activate signaling pathways that interfere with insulin signaling. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, caused by nutrient overload and impaired protein folding, activates stress kinases that also inhibit IRS-1. In skeletal muscle, impaired glucose transport due to reduced expression and translocation of GLUT4, the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter, contributes to insulin resistance. In the liver, insulin resistance leads to impaired suppression of hepatic glucose production, resulting in hyperglycemia. Adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by increased lipolysis and release of free fatty acids, further exacerbates insulin resistance in other tissues. Genetic factors also influence insulin sensitivity by affecting insulin receptor expression, signaling protein function, and mitochondrial function. The combined effects of these mechanisms lead to a vicious cycle of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and progressive β-cell dysfunction.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host's innate and adaptive immune responses to establish persistent infections?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade host immune defenses and establish persistent infections. One common mechanism involves interfering with interferon (IFN) signaling, a critical component of the innate immune response. Many viruses encode proteins that inhibit IFN production or block the signaling pathways downstream of IFN receptors, preventing the induction of antiviral genes. For example, some viruses encode decoy receptors that bind IFN, preventing it from interacting with its cellular receptor. Other viruses directly inhibit the activity of transcription factors required for IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Viruses also evade detection by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLRs and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) by sequestering their RNA or DNA within viral replication compartments, modifying their nucleic acids to prevent recognition, or encoding proteins that directly inhibit PRR signaling. To evade adaptive immunity, viruses undergo antigenic variation through mutations in surface glycoproteins, preventing antibody neutralization and T-cell recognition. Some viruses establish latency by integrating their genomes into the host cell DNA or forming episomal DNA in the nucleus, minimizing viral gene expression and immune recognition. Viruses can also directly suppress T-cell function by expressing proteins that inhibit T-cell activation, induce T-cell apoptosis, or promote the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, viruses can exploit host cell proteins to shield themselves from antibody-mediated complement activation or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The specific evasion strategies employed by a virus depend on its genome structure, replication cycle, and tropism.",

    "question": "What are the major signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves a complex interplay of signaling pathways that contribute to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Aberrant amyloid-β (Aβ) production and aggregation trigger a cascade of events, including activation of inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Aβ oligomers activate microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which exacerbate neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction. Aβ also disrupts calcium homeostasis in neurons, leading to excitotoxicity and activation of calcium-dependent proteases such as calpains. Hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which disrupt microtubule function and impair axonal transport. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) are key kinases involved in tau phosphorylation. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR and insulin receptor can modulate Aβ production and tau phosphorylation. Dysfunction of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates cell growth, survival, and autophagy, contributes to neuronal degeneration. Reduced expression of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) impairs neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. The Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a role in neuronal development and maintenance, is also dysregulated in AD. Furthermore, impairment of mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress contribute to neuronal damage. Targeting these signaling pathways is a major focus of ongoing research aimed at developing disease-modifying therapies for AD.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs via alterations in drug metabolism and transport?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs through multiple mechanisms involving alterations in drug metabolism and transport. Increased expression of drug efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the ABCB1 gene, actively pumps drugs out of the cell, reducing intracellular drug concentrations and diminishing their cytotoxic effects. This is a common mechanism of resistance to anthracyclines, taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. Conversely, decreased expression of drug uptake transporters, such as human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), can reduce the influx of drugs into the cell, conferring resistance to nucleoside analogs like gemcitabine. Cancer cells also alter drug metabolism by increasing the expression of enzymes that inactivate chemotherapy drugs or decreasing the expression of enzymes that activate prodrugs. For example, increased expression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) detoxifies alkylating agents and platinum-based drugs by conjugating them with glutathione. Furthermore, cancer cells can bypass drug-induced DNA damage by upregulating DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) or homologous recombination repair (HRR). These alterations in drug metabolism and transport are often regulated by transcription factors such as Nrf2 and NF-κB, which are activated in response to chemotherapy-induced stress. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can also influence the expression of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance, such as using inhibitors of drug efflux transporters or modulating drug metabolism.",

    "question": "What are the key differences between mRNA vaccines and traditional vaccines in terms of mechanism of action and immune response?",
    "answer": "mRNA vaccines represent a paradigm shift compared to traditional vaccines, which typically employ inactivated or attenuated pathogens, or subunit antigens, to elicit an immune response. mRNA vaccines deliver genetic instructions in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding a specific antigen, typically a viral spike protein. Once injected, the mRNA is taken up by host cells, translated into the antigen, and processed into peptides that are presented on MHC class I and II molecules, triggering both cellular and humoral immunity. Traditional vaccines, in contrast, primarily induce antibody responses and require antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to process and present antigens to T cells. mRNA vaccines elicit a stronger and broader immune response, including robust cytotoxic T cell responses, because the antigen is synthesized intracellularly, mimicking a natural viral infection. mRNA vaccines are also faster to develop and manufacture, as they do not require culturing pathogens or producing recombinant proteins. The mRNA sequence can be easily modified to target different variants or pathogens. However, mRNA vaccines require ultra-cold storage to maintain stability, and their long-term safety and efficacy are still under investigation. Traditional vaccines have a longer track record of safety and efficacy, and some can provide lifelong immunity with a single dose. mRNA vaccines typically require booster doses to maintain protective immunity. mRNA vaccines can also incorporate self-amplifying RNA to enhance protein expression and duration. Overall, mRNA vaccines offer a promising alternative to traditional vaccines, with the potential to address emerging infectious diseases and cancer.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, contribute to cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are a hallmark of cancer and contribute to tumorigenesis by silencing tumor suppressor genes, activating oncogenes, and promoting genomic instability. DNA methylation, primarily occurring at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG islands), is typically associated with gene silencing. In cancer, CpG islands in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes are frequently hypermethylated, leading to transcriptional repression. Histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, alter chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes transcriptional activation by relaxing chromatin structure, while histone deacetylation, catalyzed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), leads to chromatin condensation and gene silencing. Histone methylation can have either activating or repressive effects, depending on the specific lysine residue that is modified and the number of methyl groups added. For example, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is associated with active transcription, while histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is a repressive mark. Dysregulation of histone modifying enzymes, such as HATs, HDACs, and histone methyltransferases, is common in cancer and contributes to aberrant gene expression patterns. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can be targeted by epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and HDAC inhibitors, which have shown promise in cancer therapy. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications can influence drug resistance and metastasis. Targeting epigenetic regulators is a promising strategy for cancer therapy.",

    "question": "What are the roles of exosomes in intercellular communication and disease pathogenesis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small (30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles secreted by virtually all cell types that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA between cells. Exosomes are formed through a process involving invagination of the plasma membrane to form early endosomes, which then mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) containing intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane releases exosomes into the extracellular space. Exosomes play diverse roles in physiological processes, including immune regulation, antigen presentation, and tissue repair. In disease pathogenesis, exosomes contribute to cancer progression by promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion. Cancer cells secrete exosomes containing oncogenes, microRNAs, and signaling molecules that reprogram the tumor microenvironment and promote distant metastasis. Exosomes also facilitate drug resistance by transferring drug efflux transporters or inactivating enzymes to recipient cells. In neurodegenerative diseases, exosomes mediate the spread of misfolded proteins, such as amyloid-β and tau, between neurons, contributing to disease progression. In infectious diseases, exosomes can transmit viral RNA or proteins to uninfected cells, promoting viral replication and dissemination. Exosomes are also involved in inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Exosomes hold promise as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, as they reflect the molecular content of their parent cells. Furthermore, exosomes can be engineered as drug delivery vehicles by loading them with therapeutic agents or targeting molecules. Overall, exosomes are versatile mediators of intercellular communication with implications for various aspects of health and disease.",
