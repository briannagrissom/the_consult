    "question": "How do mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are critical for repairing double-strand DNA breaks through homologous recombination. Mutations in these genes lead to genomic instability due to impaired DNA repair, increasing the likelihood of accumulating mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This genomic instability promotes uncontrolled cell growth and increases susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Specifically, loss of BRCA1/2 function disrupts the formation of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which is essential for accurate DNA repair using the sister chromatid as a template. The resulting error-prone repair mechanisms, such as non-homologous end joining, can introduce insertions, deletions, and chromosomal rearrangements that drive tumorigenesis. Furthermore, BRCA1/2 also regulate cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis, so their inactivation can bypass normal cellular safeguards against malignant transformation.",

    "question": "What mechanisms underlie the development of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus?",
    "answer": "Staphylococcus aureus develops antibiotic resistance through several mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation, target modification, and efflux pumps. Beta-lactam resistance is frequently mediated by the production of beta-lactamase enzymes, which hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring of penicillin antibiotics. Methicillin resistance arises from the mecA gene, which encodes a modified penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) with low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. Vancomycin resistance can occur through alterations in the peptidoglycan precursors, resulting in reduced binding affinity. Additionally, S. aureus can acquire resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer via plasmids, transposons, and bacteriophages, facilitating the rapid spread of resistance determinants. The selection pressure exerted by antibiotic use drives the evolution and dissemination of these resistance mechanisms.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, while PD-L1 (Programmed death-ligand 1) is a ligand expressed on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activation and effector function, allowing tumor cells to evade immune destruction. Immunotherapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 block this interaction, thereby removing the inhibitory signal and restoring T-cell activity against the tumor. This blockade enhances T-cell proliferation, cytokine production (e.g., IFN-γ), and cytotoxic activity, leading to tumor cell killing. The effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade depends on the pre-existing immune infiltrate within the tumor microenvironment and the expression levels of PD-L1 on tumor cells and immune cells.",

    "question": "What are the key differences between CAR-T cell therapy and traditional bone marrow transplantation in treating hematological malignancies?",
    "answer": "CAR-T cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific antigen on tumor cells. These modified T cells are then infused back into the patient to target and kill cancer cells. In contrast, bone marrow transplantation (BMT) involves replacing a patient's diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells from a donor (allogeneic BMT) or the patient's own stem cells (autologous BMT). CAR-T cell therapy offers a targeted approach by directly targeting cancer cells expressing a specific antigen, while BMT aims to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system. CAR-T cell therapy is typically used for relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies, while BMT is used for a broader range of hematological disorders, including leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. BMT carries a higher risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas CAR-T cell therapy is associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase receptor contribute to lung cancer development and response to targeted therapies?",
    "answer": "Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in adenocarcinomas. These mutations, such as exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutation in exon 21, lead to constitutive activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. These mutations make tumors highly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and osimertinib. However, resistance to EGFR TKIs frequently develops, often due to the acquisition of secondary mutations like the T790M mutation in exon 20. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, is designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance. Other resistance mechanisms include bypass signaling pathways, such as MET amplification and activation of PI3K/AKT, as well as histological transformation to small cell lung cancer.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms by which viruses evade the host immune system, focusing on HIV?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade host immune responses, including antigenic variation, latency, and direct immune suppression. HIV exhibits rapid antigenic variation due to its high mutation rate and error-prone reverse transcriptase enzyme. This results in the continuous generation of new viral variants that escape antibody neutralization and T-cell recognition. HIV also establishes latency in resting CD4+ T cells, where the virus is transcriptionally silent and undetectable by the immune system. Furthermore, HIV directly suppresses immune function by infecting and depleting CD4+ T cells, which are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. HIV also encodes proteins, such as Nef and Vpu, that interfere with antigen presentation, inhibit NK cell activity, and block the antiviral effects of cytokines. These multifaceted evasion mechanisms contribute to the chronic nature of HIV infection.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells metastasize from a primary tumor to distant sites?",
    "answer": "Metastasis is a complex multistep process involving detachment from the primary tumor, intravasation into blood or lymphatic vessels, survival in circulation, extravasation at a distant site, and colonization to form a secondary tumor. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables cancer cells to lose cell-cell adhesion and acquire migratory and invasive properties. Cancer cells secrete enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix, facilitating invasion into surrounding tissues. They then enter blood or lymphatic vessels and must survive the shear stress and immune attack encountered in circulation. At distant sites, cancer cells adhere to the endothelium, extravasate into the surrounding tissue, and undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) to establish a metastatic colony. The tumor microenvironment at the metastatic site plays a crucial role in supporting tumor cell survival and growth.",

    "question": "What role do exosomes play in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA) between cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, exosomes play diverse roles in promoting tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. Tumor-derived exosomes can deliver oncogenic proteins and signaling molecules to recipient cells, promoting proliferation and survival. They can also transfer microRNAs that silence tumor suppressor genes or modulate immune cell function. Exosomes can promote angiogenesis by delivering pro-angiogenic factors to endothelial cells. Furthermore, exosomes can suppress anti-tumor immune responses by delivering immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., PD-L1) to immune cells or by inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Exosomes also contribute to drug resistance by transferring drug efflux pumps or resistance-conferring proteins to drug-sensitive cells.",

    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work, and what are its potential applications in treating genetic diseases?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene editing technology derived from a bacterial adaptive immune system. It consists of two key components: the Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a molecular scissor, and a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs Cas9 to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The gRNA is a synthetic RNA molecule that contains a 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA sequence. Once Cas9 and the gRNA form a complex, the gRNA guides Cas9 to the target DNA site, where Cas9 makes a double-strand break. The cell then repairs the break either through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can disrupt gene function, or through homology-directed repair (HDR), which uses a provided DNA template to precisely repair or insert a desired sequence. CRISPR-Cas9 has immense potential for treating genetic diseases by correcting disease-causing mutations, disrupting pathogenic genes, or inserting therapeutic genes. Applications include treating inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington's disease, as well as developing new cancer therapies and antiviral strategies.",

    "question": "Compare and contrast the mechanisms of action of small molecule inhibitors versus monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy.",
    "answer": "Small molecule inhibitors are typically synthetic organic compounds that are designed to bind to specific intracellular targets, such as kinases, proteases, or other enzymes involved in cancer cell growth and survival. They are usually administered orally and can penetrate cell membranes to reach their intracellular targets. Monoclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are large protein molecules that are designed to bind to specific extracellular targets, such as cell surface receptors or circulating growth factors. They are typically administered intravenously and exert their anti-cancer effects through various mechanisms, including blocking receptor signaling, inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Small molecule inhibitors generally have a broader spectrum of activity and can target multiple signaling pathways, while monoclonal antibodies are highly specific for their target antigen. Small molecule inhibitors are prone to developing resistance through mutations in the target protein, while monoclonal antibodies can elicit an immune response that can limit their efficacy.",
