    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology facilitate the development of new cancer therapies?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise genome editing by using a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific DNA sequence, creating a double-stranded break. This break can be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), often resulting in gene disruption, or by homology-directed repair (HDR) if a DNA template is provided, allowing for gene insertion or modification. In cancer therapy, CRISPR-Cas9 is used in several ways: (1) Ex vivo engineering of immune cells: T cells can be engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target specific tumor antigens, enhancing their cytotoxic activity. CRISPR-Cas9 can improve CAR-T cell therapy by knocking out genes that inhibit T-cell function, such as PD-1 or CTLA-4, or by inserting genes that enhance T-cell survival and proliferation. (2) In vivo gene editing of tumor cells: CRISPR-Cas9 can be delivered directly to tumor cells to disrupt oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 can target genes involved in drug resistance, making cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy or targeted therapies. (3) High-throughput drug screening: CRISPR-Cas9 libraries can be used to knock out every gene in the genome, one at a time, in cancer cell lines. This allows researchers to identify genes that are essential for cancer cell survival or drug resistance, providing new targets for drug development. (4) Modeling cancer in vitro and in vivo: CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to create cancer models by introducing specific mutations into cell lines or animal models, allowing researchers to study the mechanisms of cancer development and test new therapies. Challenges include off-target effects, delivery efficiency, and immune responses to Cas9, which are being addressed through improved Cas9 variants and delivery methods.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which gut microbiota influence host metabolism and contribute to obesity?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiota profoundly impacts host metabolism through several interconnected mechanisms. Firstly, they extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides via fermentation, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These SCFAs serve as energy sources for colonocytes (butyrate), enter the systemic circulation (acetate and propionate), and influence glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and appetite regulation. Obese individuals often exhibit altered gut microbiota composition (dysbiosis), characterized by decreased microbial diversity and an increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, which is associated with enhanced energy harvesting from the diet. Secondly, the gut microbiota regulates intestinal permeability, commonly referred to as 'leaky gut.' Dysbiosis can compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier, leading to increased translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other microbial products into the systemic circulation. This triggers chronic low-grade inflammation (meta-inflammation) by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR4, on immune cells and adipocytes. Meta-inflammation contributes to insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver and muscle. Thirdly, the gut microbiota modulates bile acid metabolism. Gut bacteria can deconjugate and transform bile acids, influencing their enterohepatic circulation and signaling via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5). Altered bile acid profiles in obese individuals can disrupt glucose and lipid metabolism, contributing to metabolic dysfunction. Fourthly, the gut microbiota produces various metabolites, including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is generated from dietary choline and L-carnitine. Elevated TMAO levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and may promote atherosclerosis through mechanisms involving macrophage foam cell formation and platelet hyperreactivity. Finally, the gut microbiota influences appetite and satiety by modulating gut hormone secretion, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Specific bacterial species can stimulate the release of these hormones, which promote satiety and improve glucose homeostasis. Disruptions in gut microbiota composition can impair gut hormone signaling, leading to increased appetite and weight gain. In summary, the gut microbiota interacts bidirectionally with host metabolism, and alterations in its composition and function contribute to the development of obesity and related metabolic disorders through complex mechanisms involving energy harvesting, intestinal permeability, inflammation, bile acid metabolism, and gut hormone regulation. Modulating the gut microbiota through dietary interventions, prebiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation holds promise for preventing and treating obesity and metabolic diseases.",

    "question": "How do immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity and what are the underlying mechanisms?",
    "answer": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) enhance anti-tumor immunity by blocking inhibitory pathways that normally regulate T-cell activation and effector function. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are two key immune checkpoints that ICIs target. CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, competes with CD28 for binding to B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). When CTLA-4 binds to B7, it delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activation and proliferation. Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, blocks this interaction, allowing CD28 to bind to B7 and deliver a co-stimulatory signal, thus promoting T-cell activation. CTLA-4 blockade primarily affects T-cell priming in the lymph nodes, enhancing the initial activation of naive T cells. PD-1, expressed on T cells, binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are often upregulated on tumor cells and APCs. PD-1 signaling inhibits T-cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including cytokine production and cytotoxic activity. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, anti-PD-1 antibodies, and atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab, anti-PD-L1 antibodies, block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, preventing T-cell inhibition and restoring T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. PD-1 blockade primarily affects T-cell function in the TME, enhancing the ability of T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. The mechanisms underlying ICI efficacy involve several key steps: (1) Enhanced T-cell activation: ICIs promote T-cell activation by blocking inhibitory signals and enhancing co-stimulatory signals. (2) Increased T-cell infiltration into the TME: ICIs can increase the number of T cells that infiltrate the TME, allowing for more effective tumor cell killing. (3) Improved T-cell effector function: ICIs enhance the ability of T cells to kill tumor cells by increasing cytokine production and cytotoxic activity. (4) Reversal of T-cell exhaustion: Chronic antigen stimulation in the TME can lead to T-cell exhaustion, characterized by reduced effector function and increased expression of inhibitory receptors. ICIs can reverse T-cell exhaustion, restoring their ability to kill tumor cells. (5) Promotion of durable anti-tumor responses: ICIs can induce durable anti-tumor responses in some patients, leading to long-term remission or even cure. However, not all patients respond to ICIs, and resistance mechanisms can develop. These include loss of antigen presentation, upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints, and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. Combination strategies, such as combining ICIs with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or other immunotherapies, are being explored to overcome resistance and improve outcomes.",

    "question": "What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase, is the initiating event in AD pathogenesis. Aβ peptides aggregate to form oligomers and fibrils, which deposit as amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma and around blood vessels (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Aβ plaques trigger a cascade of events, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction. Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, are another hallmark of AD. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neurons. Hyperphosphorylation of tau disrupts its binding to microtubules, causing tau to aggregate into paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles. Tau pathology spreads throughout the brain in a predictable pattern, correlating with disease progression. Genetic factors play a significant role in AD pathogenesis. Mutations in the APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes, which are involved in Aβ production, cause early-onset familial AD. The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD. APOE influences Aβ clearance and aggregation, as well as lipid metabolism and inflammation in the brain. Neuroinflammation is a prominent feature of AD. Microglia and astrocytes, the brain's resident immune cells, become activated in response to Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Activated microglia and astrocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction. Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in AD pathogenesis. Aβ oligomers disrupt synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, leading to cognitive impairment. Loss of synapses correlates strongly with cognitive decline in AD. Other factors, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired glucose metabolism, also contribute to AD pathogenesis. Oxidative stress, caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses, damages proteins, lipids, and DNA in the brain. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs energy production and increases ROS generation. Impaired glucose metabolism, characterized by reduced glucose uptake and utilization in the brain, contributes to neuronal dysfunction and Aβ accumulation. Therapeutic strategies for AD aim to target these molecular mechanisms. Anti-amyloid therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies that clear Aβ plaques, have shown promise in clinical trials. Tau-targeting therapies, such as inhibitors of tau phosphorylation and aggregation, are also under development. Anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, and mitochondrial enhancers are being investigated as potential treatments for AD. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and cognitive stimulation, may also play a role in preventing or delaying the onset of AD.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells evade detection and elimination by the immune system, and what strategies can be employed to overcome these mechanisms?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells employ diverse mechanisms to evade immune detection and elimination, collectively termed 'immunoediting,' which shapes tumor immunogenicity and responsiveness to immunotherapy. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into: (1) Reduced antigen presentation: Cancer cells may downregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which present tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby rendering themselves invisible to T-cell recognition. This can occur through genetic mutations, epigenetic silencing, or post-translational modifications affecting MHC-I expression or peptide loading. (2) Impaired T-cell activation: Cancer cells can express inhibitory ligands, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), that bind to immune checkpoint receptors (e.g., PD-1) on T cells, delivering inhibitory signals that suppress T-cell activation and effector function. Other inhibitory pathways, such as CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3, may also be engaged. (3) Immune suppression: Cancer cells can secrete immunosuppressive factors, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that inhibit T-cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytotoxic activity. These factors can also promote the recruitment and activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which further suppress anti-tumor immunity. (4) Immune cell exclusion: Cancer cells can physically exclude immune cells from the tumor microenvironment (TME) by creating a dense stroma, disrupting chemokine gradients, or expressing factors that inhibit immune cell migration. This can prevent T cells from reaching the tumor cells and exerting their cytotoxic effects. (5) Tolerance induction: Cancer cells can induce tolerance in T cells by presenting TAAs in the absence of co-stimulatory signals or by promoting the differentiation of naive T cells into Tregs. Tolerant T cells are unable to mount an effective anti-tumor response. Strategies to overcome these immune evasion mechanisms include: (1) Immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction: ICD-inducing therapies, such as certain chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy, and oncolytic viruses, can promote the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate the innate immune system and enhance T-cell priming. (2) Immune checkpoint blockade: Antibodies targeting immune checkpoint receptors (e.g., PD-1, CTLA-4) or their ligands (e.g., PD-L1) can block inhibitory signals and restore T-cell activity. (3) Adoptive cell therapy: T cells can be engineered ex vivo to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that recognize specific TAAs, enhancing their ability to kill tumor cells. (4) Cytokine therapy: Administration of immunostimulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon-alpha (IFN-α), can enhance T-cell proliferation and activation. (5) Oncolytic virus therapy: Oncolytic viruses can selectively infect and kill cancer cells, while also stimulating an anti-tumor immune response. (6) Combination therapies: Combining multiple immunotherapeutic approaches, such as immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, can overcome resistance mechanisms and improve outcomes.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and how can they be targeted therapeutically?",
    "answer": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints, leading to cartilage and bone destruction. Several key signaling pathways contribute to RA pathogenesis, including: (1) TNF-α signaling: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in RA. TNF-α binds to its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, on immune cells and synovial cells, activating downstream signaling pathways, such as NF-κB and MAPK, which promote the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). TNF-α also stimulates osteoclastogenesis, contributing to bone erosion. Therapeutic targeting: TNF-α inhibitors, such as etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab, block the binding of TNF-α to its receptors, thereby reducing inflammation and joint damage. (2) IL-6 signaling: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is another pro-inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in RA. IL-6 binds to its receptor, IL-6R, on immune cells and hepatocytes, activating the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. IL-6 promotes B-cell differentiation, antibody production, and acute-phase protein synthesis. Therapeutic targeting: IL-6 receptor inhibitors, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab, block the binding of IL-6 to its receptor, thereby reducing inflammation and joint damage. (3) JAK-STAT signaling: The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway is activated by various cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and IFN-γ. JAKs phosphorylate STATs, which then translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. The JAK-STAT pathway plays a critical role in immune cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Therapeutic targeting: JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib, block the activity of JAKs, thereby reducing inflammation and joint damage. (4) B-cell signaling: B cells play a role in RA pathogenesis by producing autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), which contribute to immune complex formation and inflammation. B cells also present antigens to T cells and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therapeutic targeting: B-cell depleting agents, such as rituximab, target the CD20 protein on B cells, leading to B-cell depletion and reduced inflammation. (5) T-cell signaling: T cells play a central role in RA pathogenesis by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-17, and IFN-γ, and by activating other immune cells. T-cell co-stimulation inhibitors, such as abatacept, block the interaction between CD28 on T cells and CD80/CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, thereby inhibiting T-cell activation. Other signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt, also contribute to RA pathogenesis. Therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways are under development. In summary, RA pathogenesis involves a complex interplay of signaling pathways that regulate immune cell activation, cytokine production, and joint destruction. Targeting these pathways with various therapeutic agents can effectively reduce inflammation and joint damage in RA patients.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, contribute to cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications can influence chromatin structure, accessibility of DNA to transcription factors, and ultimately, cellular phenotype and behavior. In cancer, aberrant epigenetic modifications are frequently observed and contribute to tumor development and progression by disrupting normal gene expression patterns. DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosine bases, primarily at CpG dinucleotides. In normal cells, DNA methylation is essential for maintaining genomic stability, imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. In cancer cells, DNA methylation patterns are often disrupted, with global hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation. Global hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability, activation of oncogenes, and increased mutation rates. Regional hypermethylation, particularly at CpG islands in promoter regions, can silence tumor suppressor genes, leading to loss of their function. Histone modifications involve the addition of chemical groups to histone proteins, which package DNA into chromatin. These modifications can alter chromatin structure, affecting gene transcription. Histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes gene expression by relaxing chromatin structure and increasing accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Histone deacetylation, mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), generally represses gene expression by condensing chromatin structure and reducing accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Histone methylation can have both activating and repressive effects, depending on the specific histone residue that is methylated and the number of methyl groups added. For example, methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is generally associated with active transcription, while methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is generally associated with transcriptional repression. In cancer cells, aberrant histone modifications are frequently observed and contribute to dysregulation of gene expression. For example, loss of H3K27me3 at tumor suppressor gene promoters can lead to their silencing, while increased H3K4me3 at oncogene promoters can lead to their activation. Epigenetic modifications are reversible, making them attractive targets for cancer therapy. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis), such as azacitidine and decitabine, can reverse DNA hypermethylation and restore expression of tumor suppressor genes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), such as vorinostat and romidepsin, can increase histone acetylation and activate transcription of silenced genes. Epigenetic therapies have shown promise in treating certain types of cancer, particularly hematologic malignancies. However, challenges remain in developing epigenetic therapies that are specific for cancer cells and have minimal toxicity to normal cells. Combination strategies, such as combining epigenetic therapies with other anticancer agents, are being explored to improve outcomes.",

    "question": "What are the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene expression and influencing cellular processes, particularly in the context of development and disease?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse class of RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins. They represent a significant portion of the mammalian transcriptome and play critical roles in regulating gene expression and influencing cellular processes, particularly in development and disease. LncRNAs exert their functions through diverse mechanisms, including: (1) Transcriptional regulation: LncRNAs can act as transcriptional activators or repressors by interacting with chromatin-modifying complexes, such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). For example, the lncRNA XIST recruits PRC2 to the X chromosome, leading to its inactivation. LncRNAs can also interact with transcription factors, either directly or indirectly, to regulate gene expression. (2) Post-transcriptional regulation: LncRNAs can regulate mRNA splicing, stability, and translation. For example, the lncRNA MALAT1 regulates alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs by interacting with splicing factors. LncRNAs can also act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, sequestering miRNAs and preventing them from binding to their target mRNAs, thereby increasing mRNA stability and translation. (3) Structural roles: LncRNAs can serve as structural components of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, providing a scaffold for the assembly of proteins involved in various cellular processes. For example, the lncRNA TERRA forms a complex with telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) and other proteins, regulating telomere maintenance. (4) Decoy function: LncRNAs can act as decoys, binding to proteins and preventing them from interacting with their normal targets. For example, the lncRNA HOTAIR binds to PRC2 and prevents it from binding to its target genes, leading to their activation. In development, lncRNAs play essential roles in regulating cell fate determination, differentiation, and morphogenesis. For example, the lncRNA H19 is involved in imprinting and embryonic development. In disease, aberrant expression or function of lncRNAs has been implicated in various disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. For example, the lncRNA MALAT1 is upregulated in many types of cancer and promotes tumor growth and metastasis. LncRNAs represent promising therapeutic targets. Strategies to target lncRNAs include: (1) Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs): ASOs can bind to lncRNAs and promote their degradation by RNase H. (2) Small molecule inhibitors: Small molecules can be designed to disrupt lncRNA-protein interactions or interfere with lncRNA function. (3) CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing: CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to knock out or knock down lncRNA genes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action of lncRNAs and develop effective strategies to target them for therapeutic purposes.",

    "question": "How do viruses, such as HIV or influenza, evade the host's immune system, and what are the mechanisms by which broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) can overcome these evasion strategies?",
    "answer": "Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to evade the host's immune system, ensuring their survival and replication. These evasion strategies include: (1) Antigenic variation: Viruses, such as HIV and influenza, exhibit high rates of mutation, leading to antigenic variation. This allows them to escape recognition by pre-existing antibodies and T cells. HIV, in particular, has a highly variable envelope glycoprotein (Env) that is heavily glycosylated, shielding it from antibody recognition. Influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift (minor mutations) and antigenic shift (major reassortment of viral genes), leading to the emergence of new strains that can evade immunity generated by previous infections or vaccinations. (2) Latency: Some viruses, such as HIV and herpesviruses, can establish latency, a state of viral quiescence in which the virus is not actively replicating and is therefore not susceptible to immune attack. During latency, the virus integrates its genome into the host cell's DNA and expresses only a limited number of viral genes, minimizing immune detection. (3) Immune suppression: Some viruses encode proteins that directly suppress the host's immune system. For example, HIV encodes proteins that interfere with T-cell activation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes proteins that mimic or interfere with host immune signaling pathways. (4) Glycan shielding: Many viruses, including HIV and influenza, use glycans to shield their surface proteins from antibody recognition. Glycans are sugar molecules that are added to viral proteins during glycosylation. The dense layer of glycans on the surface of HIV Env and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sterically hinders antibody binding. (5) Intracellular replication: Some viruses replicate inside cells, limiting their exposure to the extracellular immune response. For example, influenza viruses replicate in the respiratory epithelium, while HIV replicates in immune cells, such as CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are antibodies that can neutralize a wide range of viral strains. BnAbs can overcome viral evasion strategies through several mechanisms: (1) Targeting conserved epitopes: BnAbs often target conserved epitopes on viral proteins that are less prone to mutation. These epitopes are essential for viral function and cannot be easily altered without compromising viral fitness. (2) Penetrating glycan shields: Some bnAbs have evolved the ability to penetrate glycan shields and access underlying viral proteins. These antibodies often have long, flexible complementarity-determining region H3 (CDR H3) loops that can reach through the glycans and bind to conserved epitopes. (3) Multivalent binding: Some bnAbs can bind to multiple viral proteins simultaneously, increasing their avidity and neutralizing potency. (4) Fc-mediated effector functions: BnAbs can mediate Fc-dependent effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), which can eliminate virus-infected cells. The development of bnAbs is a major goal of vaccine research for HIV, influenza, and other viruses. Identifying and characterizing bnAbs can provide insights into the vulnerabilities of viruses and guide the design of effective vaccines.",
