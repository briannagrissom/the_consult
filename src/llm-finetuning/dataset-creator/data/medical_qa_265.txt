    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 technology enable precise gene editing, and what are its limitations in clinical applications?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 achieves targeted gene editing through the Cas9 enzyme, guided by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) complementary to the DNA sequence of interest. The sgRNA directs Cas9 to the target site, where it induces a double-stranded break (DSB). The cell repairs the DSB via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can cause insertions or deletions (indels), leading to gene disruption. Alternatively, if a donor DNA template is provided, homology-directed repair (HDR) can be used for precise gene insertion or replacement. While CRISPR-Cas9 offers unprecedented precision, it faces challenges in clinical translation. Off-target effects, where Cas9 cleaves unintended DNA sites due to sequence similarity, remain a concern, although engineered Cas9 variants with higher specificity have reduced these risks. Delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 components to target cells in vivo is another hurdle, with viral vectors (e.g., adeno-associated virus) and non-viral methods (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) being explored. Immune responses against Cas9 or delivery vectors can also limit efficacy and safety. Ethical considerations surrounding germline editing and potential unintended consequences necessitate careful evaluation and regulation.",

    "question": "Why is immunotherapy effective in some cancers but not others, and what mechanisms underlie resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors?",
    "answer": "Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, has revolutionized cancer treatment, but its efficacy varies significantly across cancer types and individual patients. Responsiveness correlates with pre-existing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and high tumor mutational burden (TMB), leading to neoantigen presentation that stimulates T-cell responses. \"Hot\" tumors with abundant TILs are more likely to respond than \"cold\" tumors lacking immune infiltration. Resistance mechanisms include: (1) loss of antigen presentation due to mutations in MHC genes or β2-microglobulin; (2) upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints (e.g., TIM-3, LAG-3) that compensate for PD-1 blockade; (3) immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs); (4) defects in interferon signaling pathways that impair T-cell activation; and (5) intrinsic tumor cell factors such as WNT/β-catenin signaling activation that excludes T cells from the TME. Strategies to overcome resistance involve combination therapies that target multiple immune checkpoints, modulate the TME, enhance antigen presentation, or stimulate interferon signaling. Biomarkers to predict response and resistance are actively being investigated to guide personalized immunotherapy approaches.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, contribute to cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are frequently observed in cancer and contribute to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. DNA methylation, typically occurring at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs), is often silenced in tumor suppressor gene promoters, leading to their inactivation. Conversely, global DNA hypomethylation can activate oncogenes and promote genomic instability. Histone modifications, such as acetylation (associated with active transcription) and methylation (can be activating or repressive depending on the specific lysine residue), are also dysregulated in cancer. For example, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups, leading to chromatin condensation and gene repression, and are often overexpressed in tumors. Disruptions in histone methyltransferases and demethylases can also alter gene expression patterns that promote cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Epigenetic alterations are reversible, making them attractive targets for cancer therapy. Drugs such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (e.g., azacytidine) and HDAC inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat) have shown clinical efficacy in certain cancers by restoring normal gene expression patterns. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications can influence drug resistance and immune evasion, highlighting their importance in cancer biology and therapy.",

    "question": "What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, focusing on amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. Amyloid plaques are primarily composed of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, generated by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, aggregate to form oligomers, protofibrils, and ultimately insoluble plaques. These Aβ aggregates disrupt neuronal signaling, induce oxidative stress, and trigger inflammatory responses mediated by microglia and astrocytes. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules. In AD, abnormal phosphorylation of tau causes it to detach from microtubules and self-aggregate into paired helical filaments (PHFs), forming tangles within neurons. Tau pathology disrupts axonal transport, impairs synaptic function, and ultimately leads to neuronal death. The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that Aβ accumulation initiates a cascade of events, including tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. However, the exact relationship between Aβ and tau pathology remains a subject of ongoing research. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (encoding presenilins, components of γ-secretase), increase Aβ production and the risk of early-onset AD. APOE4, a common genetic variant, also increases AD risk by influencing Aβ clearance and aggregation. Therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production, aggregation, or clearance, as well as tau phosphorylation, are under development to slow or prevent AD progression.",

    "question": "How do gut microbiota influence host immunity, and what role do they play in the development of autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, exerts profound influence on host immunity through various mechanisms. Commensal bacteria educate the immune system by stimulating the development of immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). They also promote the production of IgA antibodies that neutralize pathogens and maintain gut homeostasis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers, regulate immune cell function and reduce inflammation. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 1 diabetes (T1D). In genetically susceptible individuals, dysbiosis can disrupt immune tolerance, leading to autoreactive T cell activation and chronic inflammation. Certain bacterial species can trigger molecular mimicry, where microbial antigens resemble self-antigens, leading to autoimmune responses. For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae has been linked to ankylosing spondylitis due to sequence homology between bacterial antigens and HLA-B27. The gut microbiota also influences the efficacy of immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, in cancer. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiota, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and dietary interventions, are being explored as potential therapeutic approaches for autoimmune diseases and other immune-mediated disorders.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of colorectal cancer, and how are they targeted therapeutically?",
    "answer": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression are driven by dysregulation of several key signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and TGF-β pathways. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is frequently activated in CRC due to mutations in APC, a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates β-catenin. Activation of this pathway leads to increased expression of target genes that promote cell proliferation and survival. The RAS/MAPK pathway is activated by mutations in KRAS or BRAF, leading to constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades that promote cell growth and differentiation. The PI3K/AKT pathway is activated by mutations in PIK3CA or loss of PTEN, resulting in increased cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. The TGF-β pathway has dual roles in CRC, acting as a tumor suppressor in early stages and promoting metastasis in later stages. Therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways include: (1) inhibitors of EGFR, an upstream activator of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways (e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab); (2) BRAF inhibitors (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib) for BRAF-mutated CRCs; (3) inhibitors of MEK, a downstream kinase in the RAS/MAPK pathway (e.g., trametinib, cobimetinib); and (4) inhibitors of PI3K or AKT (currently in clinical trials). Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors are also under development, but have not yet reached clinical use. Combination therapies targeting multiple pathways are often used to overcome resistance and improve outcomes in CRC patients.",

    "question": "How does the tumor microenvironment (TME) influence cancer metastasis, and what are the key cellular and molecular components involved?",
    "answer": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in cancer metastasis by providing a permissive niche that supports tumor cell survival, invasion, and colonization at distant sites. The TME comprises various cellular and molecular components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, T cells), endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and soluble factors (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, growth factors). CAFs remodel the ECM by secreting collagen, fibronectin, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), facilitating tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis. Immune cells can have both pro- and anti-metastatic effects. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), often polarized towards an M2 phenotype, promote angiogenesis, ECM remodeling, and immune suppression, thereby facilitating metastasis. Endothelial cells form new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that provide nutrients and oxygen to the growing tumor and serve as conduits for tumor cell dissemination. The ECM provides structural support to the TME and regulates cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. Alterations in ECM composition and stiffness can promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Soluble factors secreted by tumor cells and TME components, such as VEGF, TGF-β, and IL-8, promote angiogenesis, immune suppression, and ECM remodeling, thereby driving metastasis. Interactions between tumor cells and the TME are dynamic and reciprocal, with tumor cells shaping the TME to their advantage and the TME influencing tumor cell behavior. Targeting the TME is an emerging strategy to inhibit cancer metastasis.",

    "question": "What are the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in gene regulation and cancer development?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play crucial roles in gene regulation. LncRNAs can regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic regulation. They can act as scaffolds, guides, or decoys to modulate the activity of chromatin-modifying complexes, transcription factors, and RNA-binding proteins. LncRNAs are often dysregulated in cancer and can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. For example, HOTAIR promotes metastasis in various cancers by recruiting PRC2 to silence tumor suppressor genes. MALAT1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in lung cancer by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). On the other hand, lncRNAs such as GAS5 and MEG3 act as tumor suppressors by inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis. LncRNAs can also regulate microRNA (miRNA) activity by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), sequestering miRNAs and preventing them from binding to their target mRNAs. Furthermore, lncRNAs can influence drug resistance and immune evasion in cancer. Targeting lncRNAs is an emerging strategy for cancer therapy. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be used to silence oncogenic lncRNAs, while small molecules can be developed to disrupt lncRNA-protein interactions. LncRNAs hold promise as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer.",

    "question": "How does the complement system contribute to both innate and adaptive immunity, and what role does it play in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases?",
    "answer": "The complement system, a critical component of the innate immune system, comprises a cascade of plasma proteins that enhance the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells, promote inflammation, and directly kill pathogens. It bridges innate and adaptive immunity through several mechanisms. The complement system can be activated via three pathways: the classical pathway (triggered by antibody-antigen complexes), the alternative pathway (activated by microbial surfaces), and the lectin pathway (initiated by mannose-binding lectin binding to microbial carbohydrates). Activation of these pathways leads to the formation of C3 convertase, which cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b opsonizes pathogens, facilitating their phagocytosis. C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins that recruit and activate immune cells, promoting inflammation. The terminal pathway leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which directly lyses pathogens. Dysregulation of the complement system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In SLE, immune complexes activate the classical pathway, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. In RA, complement activation contributes to joint inflammation and cartilage destruction. In AMD, dysregulation of the alternative pathway promotes inflammation and neovascularization in the retina. Inhibitors of complement components, such as C5 inhibitors (e.g., eculizumab) and C3 inhibitors (e.g., pegcetacoplan), are used to treat certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms of action of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, and how do cancer cells develop resistance to these drugs?",
    "answer": "Chemotherapeutic agents exert their cytotoxic effects through various mechanisms, targeting essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, cell division, and protein synthesis. Alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, cisplatin) damage DNA by forming covalent bonds with DNA bases, leading to DNA crosslinking and strand breaks. Antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis by mimicking natural metabolites and inhibiting key enzymes involved in nucleotide synthesis. Topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, doxorubicin) inhibit topoisomerases, enzymes that regulate DNA topology during replication and transcription, leading to DNA damage. Microtubule inhibitors (e.g., paclitaxel, vincristine) disrupt microtubule dynamics, interfering with cell division and causing mitotic arrest. Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents through multiple mechanisms, including: (1) increased drug efflux mediated by ABC transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein); (2) altered drug metabolism, leading to decreased drug activation or increased drug inactivation; (3) mutations in drug targets, reducing drug binding affinity; (4) increased DNA repair capacity, allowing cells to repair drug-induced DNA damage; (5) inactivation of apoptosis pathways, preventing cells from undergoing programmed cell death; and (6) epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes cell survival and drug resistance. Overcoming drug resistance is a major challenge in cancer therapy. Strategies to combat drug resistance include: (1) combination therapies using multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action; (2) development of new drugs that circumvent resistance mechanisms; (3) use of targeted therapies that specifically inhibit signaling pathways involved in drug resistance; and (4) modulation of the tumor microenvironment to enhance drug sensitivity.",
