    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain lead to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, particularly the T790M mutation, sterically hinder the binding of reversible EGFR inhibitors like erlotinib and gefitinib. The T790M mutation increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP, making it more competitive against the inhibitor. Additionally, other mechanisms such as activation of bypass pathways (e.g., MET amplification, PI3K/AKT activation) and downstream signaling molecules (e.g., MAPK) can contribute to resistance. Third-generation EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib were developed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by forming irreversible covalent bonds with EGFR, including the T790M mutant. However, resistance to osimertinib can also arise through mechanisms such as the C797S mutation, which prevents covalent binding, or through bypass signaling pathways.",

    "question": "Why is the gut microbiome implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in shaping immune system development and function. Dysbiosis, or imbalances in the gut microbial community, can lead to increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut'), allowing microbial products to enter the systemic circulation and activate immune cells. Specific gut bacteria can produce metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which modulate immune cell activity. Some microbial antigens may mimic self-antigens, triggering molecular mimicry and autoimmune responses. Furthermore, the gut microbiome influences the balance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells, impacting immune tolerance. Studies have shown associations between specific gut microbial compositions and various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. However, the exact mechanisms and causal relationships are still under investigation.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells utilize aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to support their rapid proliferation?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells often exhibit increased glucose uptake and preferentially metabolize glucose through glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis), producing lactate as a byproduct. This phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, provides several advantages for cancer cells. First, glycolysis generates metabolic intermediates that can be shunted into anabolic pathways, such as nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, which are essential for cell growth and division. Second, the increased production of lactate acidifies the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor invasion and metastasis by inhibiting the activity of immune cells and degrading the extracellular matrix. Third, aerobic glycolysis allows cancer cells to generate ATP rapidly, albeit less efficiently than oxidative phosphorylation, which is advantageous in hypoxic conditions or when mitochondrial function is impaired. Additionally, the Warburg effect may help cancer cells evade apoptosis by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria.",

    "question": "What role do exosomes play in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by cells that contain a variety of molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (e.g., mRNA, microRNA). Within the tumor microenvironment, exosomes mediate intercellular communication by transferring these molecules between cancer cells and stromal cells. Cancer-derived exosomes can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis by delivering oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to recipient cells. For example, exosomes can transfer drug resistance factors to sensitive cells or educate immune cells to suppress antitumor immunity. Stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and immune cells, also secrete exosomes that can influence tumor behavior. Fibroblast-derived exosomes can promote cancer cell proliferation and invasion, while immune cell-derived exosomes can either stimulate or suppress antitumor immune responses. Exosomes are also being investigated as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and as therapeutic delivery vehicles.",

  {
    "question": "How does epigenetic modification contribute to cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are commonly observed in cancer cells and contribute to various aspects of tumor development and progression. DNA hypermethylation of promoter regions can silence tumor suppressor genes, while DNA hypomethylation can activate oncogenes or repetitive elements. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, can also influence gene expression by altering chromatin structure and accessibility. For example, histone acetylation generally promotes gene transcription, while histone methylation can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the specific histone residue modified. Epigenetic modifications are often reversible, making them attractive targets for cancer therapy. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), are used to restore normal epigenetic patterns and reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes.",

    "question": "Why does prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids lead to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia?",
    "answer": "Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are steroid hormones that play a critical role in regulating glucose metabolism. Prolonged exposure to elevated glucocorticoid levels, whether due to Cushing's syndrome or exogenous administration, can lead to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia through multiple mechanisms. Glucocorticoids stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis, increasing glucose production by the liver. They also inhibit glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, by interfering with insulin signaling pathways. Glucocorticoids can also promote lipolysis, leading to increased levels of free fatty acids in the circulation, which further impair insulin sensitivity. Additionally, glucocorticoids can suppress insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. These combined effects result in elevated blood glucose levels and insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to the development of diabetes.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that block immune checkpoint proteins, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, which normally suppress T cell activation and effector function. By blocking these checkpoints, checkpoint inhibitors unleash T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. CTLA-4 inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, primarily act in the early stages of T cell activation in the lymph nodes by blocking the interaction between CTLA-4 and its ligands (B7-1/B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thereby enhancing T cell priming. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, primarily act in the tumor microenvironment by blocking the interaction between PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells or other cells in the microenvironment, thereby preventing T cell exhaustion and restoring their cytotoxic activity. Checkpoint inhibitors have shown remarkable clinical efficacy in various cancers; however, they can also cause immune-related adverse events due to the broad activation of the immune system.",

    "question": "Why are viruses, particularly retroviruses, used in gene therapy?",
    "answer": "Viruses are highly efficient at delivering genetic material into cells, making them ideal vectors for gene therapy. Retroviruses, such as lentiviruses, are commonly used because they can integrate their genetic material into the host cell's genome, allowing for long-term gene expression. Adenoviruses are another type of viral vector that can efficiently transduce cells but do not integrate into the host genome, resulting in transient gene expression. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are also widely used due to their low immunogenicity and broad tropism. However, viral vectors also have limitations, such as potential immunogenicity, insertional mutagenesis (for integrating vectors), and limited packaging capacity. Researchers are continually developing novel viral vectors with improved safety and efficacy profiles.",

    "question": "How do long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression in cancer cells?",
    "answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins. However, they play crucial roles in regulating gene expression at various levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic regulation. LncRNAs can act as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific DNA regions and influencing chromatin structure and gene transcription. They can also act as decoys, sequestering transcription factors or RNA-binding proteins and preventing them from interacting with their target genes. Additionally, lncRNAs can act as guides, directing RNA-modifying enzymes to specific RNA transcripts and influencing their stability or translation. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs is frequently observed in cancer cells, where they can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. LncRNAs are also being investigated as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for cancer.",

    "answer": "Personalized medicine tailors treatment strategies to individual patients based on their unique genetic and molecular characteristics. In cancer, personalized medicine is crucial because tumors are highly heterogeneous, both within and between patients. Genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression patterns can vary significantly, influencing tumor behavior and response to therapy. By identifying specific biomarkers, such as oncogenic driver mutations or immune checkpoint expression, clinicians can select the most effective treatments for each patient, avoiding unnecessary toxicities and improving outcomes. Personalized medicine also involves monitoring treatment response and adapting therapy as needed based on evolving tumor characteristics. Advances in genomic sequencing, liquid biopsies, and computational biology are driving the development of personalized medicine approaches in cancer.",
