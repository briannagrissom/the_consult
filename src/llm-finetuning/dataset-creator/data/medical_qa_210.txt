    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work at a molecular level?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to a target DNA sequence, which directs the Cas9 endonuclease to that specific genomic location. Cas9 then creates a double-stranded break (DSB) in the DNA. The cell repairs this break via one of two main pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and can introduce insertions or deletions (indels) leading to gene disruption, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which uses a provided DNA template to repair the break with high precision, allowing for gene editing or insertion of new sequences. The specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 depends on the unique sequence of the gRNA, making it highly adaptable for targeting virtually any gene in any organism. Off-target effects remain a concern and are being addressed through improved Cas9 variants with higher fidelity and computational methods for gRNA design.",

    "question": "Why is immunotherapy less effective in some 'cold' tumors compared to 'hot' tumors, and what strategies are being developed to address this?",
    "answer": "Immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, relies on pre-existing immune infiltration and activity within the tumor microenvironment to be effective. 'Hot' tumors are characterized by a high degree of T-cell infiltration, expression of PD-L1, and a generally inflamed microenvironment, rendering them susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade. In contrast, 'cold' tumors lack these features, often due to poor antigen presentation, immunosuppressive factors like TGF-β and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or physical barriers preventing immune cell access. Strategies to convert cold tumors to hot tumors include oncolytic viruses to stimulate innate immune responses and release tumor antigens, STING agonists to activate the interferon pathway, and epigenetic modifiers to increase antigen presentation and reduce immunosuppression. Combinations of these approaches with checkpoint inhibitors are under active investigation to broaden the applicability of immunotherapy.",

  {
    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, influence cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, typically at CpG islands, often leads to gene silencing by recruiting methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins and promoting chromatin condensation. Histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes gene transcription by relaxing chromatin structure and facilitating access of transcription factors. In cancer, aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes, are frequently observed. Similarly, altered histone acetylation patterns can contribute to oncogenesis by dysregulating critical cellular pathways involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), are used to reverse these aberrant epigenetic marks and restore normal gene expression patterns, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting epigenetic mechanisms in cancer.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in modulating the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome significantly influences both the efficacy and toxicity of many chemotherapeutic agents. Certain bacteria can metabolize chemotherapy drugs, either activating them (e.g., irinotecan by bacterial β-glucuronidase) or inactivating them (e.g., gemcitabine by bacterial cytidine deaminase). The composition of the gut microbiome also affects the host's immune response, which can impact the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Dysbiosis induced by chemotherapy can disrupt the intestinal barrier, leading to increased inflammation and systemic toxicity, such as mucositis and neutropenia. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and prebiotics, are being investigated to improve chemotherapy outcomes and reduce adverse effects. Personalized approaches that consider the patient's unique gut microbiome profile may optimize chemotherapy regimens in the future.",

    "question": "How do prions cause neurodegenerative diseases, and what makes them different from other infectious agents?",
    "answer": "Prions are misfolded proteins that can induce other normal proteins to misfold in a similar manner, leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates that damage neural tissue. Unlike bacteria or viruses, prions do not contain nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). The prion protein (PrP) exists in a normal cellular form (PrPC) and a misfolded, infectious form (PrPSc). PrPSc acts as a template, converting PrPC into more PrPSc, resulting in a self-propagating process that accumulates over time and disrupts neuronal function. This process is responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. The resistance of prions to conventional sterilization methods (e.g., autoclaving and irradiation) poses a significant challenge in preventing prion transmission.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms by which viruses evade the host's immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ multiple strategies to evade the host's immune responses. These include: (1) Antigenic variation: Viruses like influenza undergo frequent mutations (antigenic drift) or reassortment of genomic segments (antigenic shift) to alter surface proteins recognized by antibodies, rendering previous immunity ineffective. (2) Interference with interferon signaling: Many viruses encode proteins that inhibit the production or signaling of type I interferons (IFN-α/β), critical cytokines for antiviral defense. (3) Inhibition of antigen presentation: Viruses can block the presentation of viral antigens on MHC class I molecules, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). (4) Evasion of complement: Some viruses express proteins that inhibit the complement cascade, a key component of innate immunity. (5) Latency: Viruses like herpesviruses establish latent infections, remaining dormant within host cells and evading immune detection until reactivated. These immune evasion mechanisms contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis.",

    "question": "How do non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, regulate gene expression and contribute to human disease?",
    "answer": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA molecules that do not encode proteins but play critical regulatory roles in gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ncRNAs (approximately 22 nucleotides) that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are longer than 200 nucleotides and exert diverse regulatory functions, including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional processing. ncRNAs are involved in virtually all cellular processes, and their dysregulation has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. For example, certain miRNAs act as tumor suppressors by inhibiting oncogene expression, while others function as oncogenes by targeting tumor suppressor mRNAs. LncRNAs can act as scaffolds, bringing together different proteins to regulate gene expression or serve as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), sequestering miRNAs and preventing them from binding to their target mRNAs. Targeting ncRNAs represents a promising therapeutic strategy for various diseases.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and their potential application in diagnostics and therapeutics?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (including mRNAs and miRNAs) to recipient cells. Exosomes play a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune responses, cancer metastasis, and neurodegenerative diseases. The cargo of exosomes reflects the cellular origin and can influence the behavior of recipient cells, for instance, by transferring oncogenic proteins or miRNAs that promote tumor growth. Exosomes have emerged as promising biomarkers for disease diagnosis because their contents can provide a snapshot of the originating cell's state. Liquid biopsies based on exosome analysis are being developed to detect early-stage cancer and monitor treatment response. Furthermore, exosomes can be engineered to deliver therapeutic agents, such as drugs or siRNAs, directly to target cells, offering a novel approach for targeted drug delivery.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway contribute to the development of various cancers?",
    "answer": "The RAS-MAPK pathway is a critical signaling cascade that regulates cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is frequently dysregulated in cancer due to activating mutations in RAS genes (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS) or downstream components of the pathway, such as BRAF, MEK, and ERK. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the pathway, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. For example, KRAS mutations are common in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, while BRAF mutations are prevalent in melanoma. Activated RAS binds to and activates RAF kinases, which then phosphorylate and activate MEK kinases. MEK, in turn, phosphorylates and activates ERK kinases, which translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription factors that drive cell cycle progression and survival. Targeted therapies, such as MEK inhibitors and BRAF inhibitors, have been developed to block the aberrant signaling in tumors with RAS-MAPK pathway mutations, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in cancer pathogenesis.",

  {
    "question": "What are the mechanisms of action of novel immunotherapies like CAR-T cell therapy and bispecific antibodies in treating cancer?",
    "answer": "CAR-T cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific antigen on tumor cells. These modified T cells are then infused back into the patient, where they specifically target and kill cancer cells expressing the target antigen. The CAR typically consists of an extracellular antigen-binding domain (often derived from an antibody), a transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains that activate the T cell upon antigen binding. Bispecific antibodies are engineered antibodies that can simultaneously bind to two different antigens. In cancer immunotherapy, bispecific antibodies can bridge T cells to tumor cells, facilitating T-cell activation and tumor cell lysis. For example, a bispecific antibody might bind to CD3 on T cells and a tumor-associated antigen, such as CD19 on B-cell lymphomas, bringing the T cell into close proximity with the tumor cell and triggering T-cell-mediated killing. Both CAR-T cell therapy and bispecific antibodies represent powerful approaches to redirect the immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells, but they can also cause significant side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.",
