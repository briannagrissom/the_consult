    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology work at a molecular level, and what are its limitations?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 is an adaptive immune system found in bacteria that has been harnessed for precise genome editing. It relies on a guide RNA (gRNA) designed to be complementary to a specific DNA sequence, which then directs the Cas9 nuclease to that target site. Cas9 induces a double-stranded break (DSB) at the targeted location. The cell then attempts to repair this break through one of two main pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ is error-prone and often leads to small insertions or deletions (indels), effectively disrupting the gene. HDR, on the other hand, uses a provided DNA template to repair the break, allowing for precise gene editing or insertion. Key limitations include off-target effects (Cas9 cleaving at unintended sites with similar sequences), delivery challenges (getting the CRISPR-Cas9 components into the desired cells or tissues, especially in vivo), and immune responses against Cas9, particularly with certain Cas9 orthologs. Mosaicism, where only some cells are edited, is also a hurdle, especially in developmental biology. Ethical concerns surrounding germline editing and potential for unintended consequences also remain a significant aspect of CRISPR research.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms of action for metformin in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus?",
    "answer": "Metformin, a biguanide, primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, leading to decreased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). AMPK activation also promotes glucose uptake in peripheral tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle) by increasing the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface. Furthermore, metformin has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in the liver and muscle, although the precise mechanisms remain under investigation. Metformin also modestly decreases intestinal glucose absorption and alters the gut microbiome, potentially contributing to its glucose-lowering effects. The drug's impact on mitochondrial respiration and redox state may also play a role in its mechanism of action. While metformin is generally well-tolerated, it can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea and nausea, due to its effects on the gut. Rarely, it can lead to lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 antibodies enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, work by blocking inhibitory signaling pathways that normally dampen T-cell responses. PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) is expressed on T cells and binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are often upregulated on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment. This interaction delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector function, promoting immune evasion. Anti-PD-1 antibodies block this interaction, allowing T cells to remain active and target tumor cells. CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) is another checkpoint molecule expressed on T cells that competes with CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity for B7 than CD28, and its binding delivers an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies block this interaction, enhancing T-cell activation. Combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies can be more effective than either agent alone, but it also increases the risk of immune-related adverse events.",

    "question": "What are the key differences between mRNA vaccines and traditional vaccines in terms of mechanism of action and potential advantages?",
    "answer": "Traditional vaccines typically introduce weakened or inactivated pathogens (or their subunits) to stimulate an immune response. In contrast, mRNA vaccines deliver genetic instructions in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encode a specific antigen, such as a viral spike protein. Once inside the host cell, the mRNA is translated by ribosomes to produce the antigen, which then triggers an immune response. This eliminates the need to culture or manipulate live pathogens, potentially accelerating vaccine development and manufacturing. mRNA vaccines also elicit both humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (T-cell-mediated) immunity. Potential advantages include rapid scalability, ease of modification to address emerging variants, and the ability to induce strong immune responses. However, mRNA vaccines require ultra-cold storage for stability, and there are ongoing investigations into the long-term durability of the immune response and potential for adverse effects.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR gene contribute to lung cancer development and response to targeted therapies?",
    "answer": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Activating mutations in EGFR, particularly in exons 19 (deletions) and 21 (L858R point mutation), are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in adenocarcinomas, women, non-smokers, and individuals of East Asian descent. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of EGFR signaling, promoting uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. EGFR-mutant lung cancers are often sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and osimertinib, which competitively bind to the ATP-binding site of the EGFR kinase domain, inhibiting its activity. However, resistance to EGFR TKIs can develop through various mechanisms, including the acquisition of secondary mutations such as T790M in exon 20. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR TKI that is effective against both EGFR-activating mutations and the T790M resistance mutation. Other resistance mechanisms include activation of bypass signaling pathways (e.g., MET amplification, PI3K/AKT activation) and histological transformation to small cell lung cancer.",

    "question": "What is the role of the gut microbiome in influencing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in modulating the immune system and can significantly impact the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors. Certain bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been associated with improved responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with melanoma and lung cancer. These bacteria can enhance T-cell activation and infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, dysbiosis (imbalance in the gut microbiome) and the presence of other bacterial species can promote immune suppression and resistance to immunotherapy. The mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences immunotherapy response include modulation of dendritic cell function, production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that regulate T-cell activity, and activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that trigger immune signaling pathways. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) studies have shown that transferring the gut microbiome from responders to non-responders can improve their response to immunotherapy. Antibiotic use, which disrupts the gut microbiome, has been associated with decreased efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as dietary interventions, probiotics, and FMT, are being investigated as potential ways to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",

    "question": "How does gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) work, and what are the challenges associated with this approach?",
    "answer": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are commonly used as vectors for gene therapy due to their low immunogenicity and broad tropism. AAVs are small, non-enveloped viruses that can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells. In gene therapy, the therapeutic gene is packaged into an AAV vector, which is then delivered to the target cells. Once inside the cell, the AAV vector enters the nucleus, where the therapeutic gene is expressed, leading to the production of the desired protein. Unlike retroviruses, AAVs do not integrate their DNA into the host genome, which reduces the risk of insertional mutagenesis. However, this also means that the therapeutic gene is expressed episomally, and its expression may be lost over time as the cells divide. Challenges associated with AAV gene therapy include pre-existing immunity to AAV (many people have been exposed to AAV in the past), limited packaging capacity (AAVs can only carry relatively small genes), and potential for off-target effects. High doses of AAV can also trigger an immune response, leading to liver inflammation. Strategies to overcome these challenges include developing novel AAV serotypes with improved tropism and reduced immunogenicity, using smaller gene constructs, and developing methods to enhance gene expression.",

    "question": "What are the key molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Amyloid plaques are formed by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, are prone to aggregation, forming oligomers and fibrils that deposit as plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules. In AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, leading to its detachment from microtubules and aggregation into paired helical filaments that form tangles. The accumulation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles leads to neuronal dysfunction, synaptic loss, and neuronal death, ultimately resulting in cognitive decline. Other molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis include inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired clearance of Aβ and tau. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), can increase Aβ production and increase the risk of early-onset AD. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.",

    "question": "How do non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), regulate gene expression in cancer?",
    "answer": "Non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), play a critical role in regulating gene expression in cancer by modulating mRNA stability and translation. miRNAs are small (approximately 22 nucleotide) RNA molecules that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Each miRNA can target multiple mRNAs, and each mRNA can be targeted by multiple miRNAs, resulting in a complex regulatory network. In cancer, miRNAs can function as oncogenes (oncomiRs) or tumor suppressors, depending on their target genes. OncomiRs promote cancer development by targeting tumor suppressor genes, while tumor suppressor miRNAs inhibit cancer development by targeting oncogenes. For example, the miR-17-92 cluster is an oncomiR that is frequently overexpressed in various cancers, promoting cell proliferation and survival by targeting tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN and BIM. Conversely, miR-34a is a tumor suppressor miRNA that is often downregulated in cancer, leading to increased expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC and BCL2. miRNAs can also influence cancer metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. miRNAs are being explored as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as therapeutic targets.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms underlying the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and what strategies are being developed to combat this growing threat?",
    "answer": "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria arises through various mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics (e.g., β-lactamases that hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics), alteration of the antibiotic target site (e.g., mutations in ribosomal proteins that confer resistance to macrolides), decreased antibiotic uptake (e.g., mutations in porins that reduce the entry of antibiotics into the cell), and increased antibiotic efflux (e.g., overexpression of efflux pumps that pump antibiotics out of the cell). Horizontal gene transfer, such as conjugation, transduction, and transformation, plays a critical role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria. Strategies to combat antibiotic resistance include developing new antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action, using combination therapy with multiple antibiotics, developing inhibitors of resistance mechanisms (e.g., β-lactamase inhibitors), improving antibiotic stewardship to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, and exploring alternative therapies such as bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, and immunomodulatory agents. Developing vaccines against antibiotic-resistant bacteria is also an important strategy for preventing infections. Furthermore, research into the human microbiome and its role in preventing colonization by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is ongoing.",
