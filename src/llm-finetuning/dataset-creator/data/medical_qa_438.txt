    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR signaling pathway contribute to tumorigenesis and drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Mutations in EGFR, particularly in exons 18-21, lead to constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades such as RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT pathways, driving cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Common mutations like L858R and exon 19 deletions increase sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib. However, acquired resistance frequently develops, most commonly due to the T790M mutation, which sterically hinders TKI binding. Other resistance mechanisms include MET amplification, bypass signaling through HER2/HER3, and phenotypic transformation to small cell lung cancer. Third-generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib are designed to overcome T790M resistance, but further mutations (e.g., C797S) and bypass mechanisms can eventually emerge, necessitating combination strategies and novel therapeutic approaches targeting downstream effectors or alternative pathways.",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome profoundly impacts cancer chemotherapy through modulation of drug metabolism, immune responses, and intestinal barrier function. Certain bacteria can directly metabolize chemotherapeutic agents like irinotecan, converting them into either more active or inactive forms, thus altering systemic drug exposure. The microbiome also influences the host immune system, impacting the efficacy of immunotherapies and modulating chemotherapy-induced inflammation. Dysbiosis, or disruption of the gut microbiota, can lead to increased intestinal permeability, promoting translocation of bacteria and bacterial products into the bloodstream, which triggers systemic inflammation and exacerbates chemotherapy-induced side effects such as mucositis and diarrhea. Conversely, specific bacterial species can enhance the antitumor effects of chemotherapy by stimulating immune responses or producing metabolites with direct cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. Fecal microbiota transplantation and dietary interventions are under investigation to modulate the gut microbiome and improve outcomes in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.",

    "question": "What is the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and disease pathogenesis?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are nanoscale extracellular vesicles secreted by cells that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, mRNA, and microRNA to recipient cells. They play diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes. In cancer, exosomes facilitate tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion by delivering oncogenic proteins and microRNAs to distant sites and by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Exosomes derived from immune cells can modulate immune responses, either promoting or suppressing inflammation depending on their cargo. In neurodegenerative diseases, exosomes contribute to the spread of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-beta and tau, propagating disease pathology. They also play a role in infectious diseases by facilitating the transmission of pathogens between cells. Exosomes hold promise as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and as therapeutic delivery vehicles due to their ability to target specific cells and tissues.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, regulate gene expression in development and disease?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation, typically at CpG dinucleotides, is associated with gene silencing by recruiting methyl-binding proteins and histone deacetylases, leading to chromatin condensation and reduced transcriptional accessibility. Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes gene expression by neutralizing the positive charge of histones, weakening their interaction with negatively charged DNA, and facilitating the recruitment of transcriptional activators. Histone deacetylation, mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), reverses this process, leading to chromatin compaction and gene repression. These epigenetic marks are dynamically regulated by enzymes and are influenced by environmental factors. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where they can lead to inappropriate activation of oncogenes or silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, are used to reverse these aberrant modifications and restore normal gene expression patterns.",

    "question": "What are the key mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis involves several key mechanisms, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque formation, tau protein aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Aβ plaques are formed by the aggregation of Aβ peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. These plaques trigger neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction. Tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein, becomes hyperphosphorylated and aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting axonal transport and leading to neuronal death. Neuroinflammation, driven by activated microglia and astrocytes, contributes to neuronal damage through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Synaptic dysfunction, characterized by loss of synapses and impaired synaptic plasticity, is an early event in the disease and correlates with cognitive decline. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, and the APOE4 allele, increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms are under development, including Aβ-lowering therapies, tau aggregation inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents.",

    "question": "How do cancer cells exploit metabolic pathways to support their rapid proliferation and survival?",
    "answer": "Cancer cells exhibit altered metabolic pathways to meet the increased energy and biosynthetic demands of rapid proliferation. The Warburg effect describes the preference of cancer cells for glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen, resulting in increased lactate production. This allows cancer cells to generate ATP and biosynthetic precursors more quickly, albeit less efficiently. Cancer cells also upregulate glutamine metabolism, using glutamine as a carbon and nitrogen source for biosynthesis. They exhibit increased fatty acid synthesis to generate lipids for membrane production and energy storage. Cancer cells also reprogram amino acid metabolism to support protein synthesis and redox balance. Oncogenes, such as MYC and HIF1A, and tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, regulate these metabolic pathways. Targeting cancer metabolism is an area of active research, with strategies aimed at inhibiting glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis. Examples include the use of 2-deoxyglucose to inhibit glycolysis, glutaminase inhibitors to block glutamine metabolism, and inhibitors of fatty acid synthase to disrupt lipid synthesis.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms by which viruses evade the host immune system?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade the host immune system, including interfering with interferon signaling, inhibiting antigen presentation, and modulating immune cell function. Many viruses encode proteins that block the production or signaling of type I interferons (IFN-α/β), which are critical for antiviral defense. Some viruses interfere with antigen processing and presentation by MHC class I molecules, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Viruses can also suppress the activity of natural killer (NK) cells by expressing ligands that inhibit NK cell activation or by downregulating ligands that stimulate NK cell activation. Some viruses establish latency, a state of dormancy in which the virus persists within the host without causing active replication, thereby evading immune detection. Viruses also exhibit antigenic variation through mutation or recombination, allowing them to escape antibody recognition. Immunosuppressive viruses, such as HIV, directly infect and kill immune cells, leading to immune deficiency. These mechanisms of immune evasion contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis.",

    "question": "How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development and progression of cancer?",
    "answer": "Chronic inflammation promotes cancer development and progression through multiple mechanisms. Inflammatory cells release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that damage DNA, increasing the risk of mutations and genomic instability. Inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, promote cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Chronic inflammation also leads to the recruitment and activation of immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, which release growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases that remodel the extracellular matrix, facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, inflammation can suppress adaptive immunity, impairing the ability of the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. The transcription factor NF-κB plays a central role in mediating the pro-tumorigenic effects of inflammation by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and chronic infections, are associated with an increased risk of developing specific types of cancer.",

    "question": "How do mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene promote cancer development?",
    "answer": "Mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the p53 tumor suppressor protein, are among the most common genetic alterations in human cancers. p53 functions as a transcription factor that activates genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence in response to cellular stress signals such as DNA damage, oncogene activation, and hypoxia. Loss of p53 function impairs these protective mechanisms, allowing cells with damaged DNA to continue dividing, increasing the risk of accumulating further mutations and promoting genomic instability. Some p53 mutations result in a dominant-negative effect, where the mutant p53 protein interferes with the function of the wild-type p53 protein. Other p53 mutations result in gain-of-function activities, where the mutant p53 protein promotes cell proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Restoration of p53 function or targeting mutant p53 proteins are areas of active research in cancer therapy.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitor therapies work to enhance anti-tumor immunity?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitor therapies work by blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, which normally dampen T cell activation and function. CTLA-4 is expressed on T cells and competes with the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells, thereby inhibiting T cell activation. PD-1 is expressed on T cells and binds to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed on tumor cells and immune cells, leading to T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. By blocking these checkpoints with monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors enhance T cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Checkpoint inhibitor therapies have shown remarkable success in treating various types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. However, they can also cause immune-related adverse events due to the increased activity of the immune system. Predictive biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden, are used to identify patients who are more likely to respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.",
