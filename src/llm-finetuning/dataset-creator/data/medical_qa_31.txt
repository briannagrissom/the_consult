    "question": "How do mutations in the EGFR gene lead to targeted therapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "answer": "Activating EGFR mutations (e.g., exon 19 deletions, L858R) sensitize NSCLC cells to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like gefitinib and erlotinib. However, acquired resistance commonly develops, frequently due to the emergence of the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20. This mutation increases the ATP-binding affinity of EGFR, reducing the effectiveness of first- and second-generation TKIs. Other resistance mechanisms include MET amplification, bypass signaling activation (e.g., PI3K/AKT), and histological transformation (e.g., to small cell lung cancer). Third-generation TKIs like osimertinib were designed to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by binding irreversibly and selectively to both EGFR-activating mutations and T790M. However, resistance to osimertinib can also arise, often through C797S mutations, bypass signaling, or downstream mutations. Liquid biopsies and repeat tissue biopsies are increasingly used to identify resistance mechanisms and guide subsequent treatment strategies. Combinatorial approaches targeting multiple signaling pathways are also being explored to delay or overcome resistance.",

    "question": "What is the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in IBD pathogenesis through dysbiosis, characterized by decreased microbial diversity, reduced beneficial bacteria (e.g., *Firmicutes*), and increased pathobionts (e.g., *Escherichia coli*). This dysbiosis disrupts the intestinal barrier function, leading to increased permeability and translocation of microbial products (e.g., LPS) into the lamina propria. These microbial products activate innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that drive chronic inflammation. Furthermore, altered microbial metabolism can lead to decreased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), like butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory properties and promote intestinal epithelial cell health. Genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and immune dysregulation interact with the gut microbiota to determine the development and severity of IBD. Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being explored to restore microbial balance and reduce inflammation in IBD patients.",

    "question": "What are the key signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves several interconnected signaling pathways. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing leads to the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, activating inflammatory pathways and causing synaptic dysfunction. Aβ oligomers trigger tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting neuronal transport and contributing to neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction further exacerbate neuronal damage. Key signaling pathways include the activation of kinases (e.g., GSK-3β, CDK5) involved in tau phosphorylation, the activation of inflammatory pathways mediated by microglia and astrocytes, and the impairment of neurotrophic signaling pathways like BDNF. Genetic factors (e.g., APOE4) and environmental factors influence these pathways, contributing to the heterogeneity of AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways, such as Aβ clearance, tau aggregation inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents, are under development to slow down or prevent AD progression.",

    "question": "How do checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity in cancer therapy?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, block inhibitory signals that normally dampen T-cell activation and effector function. CTLA-4 blockade enhances T-cell priming in lymph nodes by preventing CTLA-4 from outcompeting CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thus promoting T-cell activation and proliferation. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade restores T-cell activity in the tumor microenvironment by preventing PD-1 on T-cells from binding to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells or immune cells, thus relieving T-cell exhaustion and promoting tumor cell killing. These checkpoint inhibitors unleash pre-existing anti-tumor T-cell responses and can induce durable remissions in some patients. However, they can also cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to the broad activation of the immune system. Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB), are being used to predict response to checkpoint inhibitors, but their predictive accuracy is limited. Combination therapies and novel checkpoint targets are being explored to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity.",

    "question": "What is the mechanism by which metformin improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, which in turn inhibits hepatic glucose production and enhances glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Metformin also improves insulin sensitivity by modulating the expression and activity of glucose transporters (GLUTs), particularly GLUT4, in skeletal muscle. Additionally, metformin may have indirect effects on insulin sensitivity by altering gut microbiota composition and increasing incretin hormone levels. While the precise molecular mechanisms of metformin action are still being investigated, its primary effects are believed to be mediated through AMPK activation in the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to reduced hepatic glucose output and improved peripheral glucose uptake.",

    "question": "How do viruses evade the host immune system to establish persistent infections?",
    "answer": "Viruses employ diverse strategies to evade host immune responses and establish persistent infections. These include antigenic variation (e.g., influenza virus) to escape antibody neutralization, latency (e.g., herpesviruses) to remain dormant within host cells, and interference with interferon (IFN) signaling to suppress antiviral defenses. Some viruses express decoy receptors to bind and neutralize cytokines, while others express proteins that inhibit complement activation or NK cell activity. HIV, for example, infects and depletes CD4+ T cells, impairing adaptive immunity. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) interferes with IFN signaling and induces T-cell exhaustion. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses viral homologs of host proteins to manipulate cell signaling pathways. These immune evasion mechanisms allow viruses to replicate and persist within the host, leading to chronic infections and potentially severe disease. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies and vaccines.",

    "question": "What are the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "Autoimmune diseases arise from a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and immune dysregulation, leading to the breakdown of self-tolerance and the attack of the immune system on the body's own tissues. Genetic factors, such as HLA alleles, contribute to the risk of developing autoimmune diseases. Environmental factors, such as infections and exposure to certain chemicals, can trigger autoimmune responses in genetically predisposed individuals. Key mechanisms include molecular mimicry, bystander activation, and epitope spreading. Defects in central tolerance (thymic deletion of autoreactive T cells) and peripheral tolerance (regulatory T cells, anergy) contribute to the survival and activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. B cells produce autoantibodies that can directly damage tissues or form immune complexes that deposit in tissues, causing inflammation. Cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-17, play a crucial role in driving chronic inflammation in autoimmune diseases. Therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms, such as immunosuppressants and biologics, are used to control disease activity and prevent organ damage.",

    "question": "How does gene therapy work, and what are its potential applications in treating genetic disorders?",
    "answer": "Gene therapy involves introducing genetic material into cells to treat or prevent disease. It typically uses viral vectors (e.g., adeno-associated virus, lentivirus) to deliver a therapeutic gene into target cells. The therapeutic gene can replace a mutated gene, inactivate a disease-causing gene, or introduce a new gene to enhance cellular function. Ex vivo gene therapy involves modifying cells outside the body and then transplanting them back into the patient, while in vivo gene therapy involves delivering the therapeutic gene directly into the patient's body. Gene therapy has shown promise in treating genetic disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), hemophilia, and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). It also has potential applications in treating cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. However, challenges remain, including vector immunogenicity, off-target effects, and the durability of gene expression. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is a promising new technology that allows for precise editing of the genome and has the potential to revolutionize gene therapy.",

    "question": "What are the major mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bacteria?",
    "answer": "Bacteria have evolved multiple mechanisms to resist the effects of antibiotics. These include enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics (e.g., beta-lactamases hydrolyzing beta-lactam antibiotics), alteration of the antibiotic target site (e.g., mutations in ribosomal RNA conferring resistance to macrolides), decreased antibiotic uptake (e.g., mutations in porin channels), and increased antibiotic efflux (e.g., multidrug efflux pumps). Horizontal gene transfer, such as conjugation, transduction, and transformation, facilitates the spread of resistance genes between bacteria. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture have driven the selection and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Strategies to combat antibiotic resistance include developing new antibiotics, implementing antibiotic stewardship programs, and using combination therapies. Understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant infections.",

Immunotherapy has shown remarkable success in treating certain cancers, such as melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia, but it is not effective for all patients or all cancer types. Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB), are being used to predict response to immunotherapy, but their predictive accuracy is limited.
