    "question": "How does CRISPR-Cas9 technology enable precise genome editing, and what are its limitations in therapeutic applications?",
    "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 harnesses a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA sequence, creating a double-stranded break that triggers either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) for gene disruption or homology-directed repair (HDR) for precise sequence insertion or correction. The simplicity and efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 have revolutionized gene editing, but limitations include off-target effects due to sequence similarity, delivery challenges to specific tissues, potential immunogenicity of Cas9, and ethical concerns surrounding germline editing. HDR is also less efficient than NHEJ, particularly in non-dividing cells. Clinical trials are underway to address these limitations through modified Cas enzymes with higher specificity, improved delivery vectors such as adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and strategies to mitigate immune responses. Long-term safety and efficacy data are still needed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9.",

    "question": "Why do some cancers develop resistance to targeted therapies, and what mechanisms are involved?",
    "answer": "Resistance to targeted therapies often arises through multiple mechanisms, including on-target resistance due to mutations in the drug target that prevent binding, bypass signaling through activation of alternative pathways, downstream mutations that negate the effect of the inhibited pathway, and phenotypic changes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that confer drug tolerance. For example, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung cancer frequently encounter resistance through the T790M mutation in EGFR or activation of MET amplification. Bypass signaling can occur through activation of PI3K/AKT or RAS/MAPK pathways. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing combination therapies that target multiple pathways or for identifying predictive biomarkers that can guide treatment selection. Adaptive resistance, where cells transiently alter their phenotype in response to drug exposure, further complicates the landscape and necessitates dynamic monitoring and adaptive treatment strategies.",

    "question": "How does immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity, and what are the common immune-related adverse events?",
    "answer": "Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, block inhibitory signals that normally dampen T-cell activation, thereby unleashing the immune system to attack cancer cells. PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade disrupt the interaction between T cells and tumor cells, preventing T-cell exhaustion and promoting cytotoxic activity. CTLA-4 blockade enhances T-cell priming and activation in lymph nodes. Common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies (thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes), and dermatitis, resulting from the broad activation of the immune system. Management of irAEs often involves corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants. The specific irAEs and their severity vary depending on the checkpoint inhibitor used and the individual patient's immune system. Predictive biomarkers for response and toxicity are actively being investigated to personalize immunotherapy and improve patient outcomes.",

    "question": "What role do exosomes play in intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment, and how can they be targeted therapeutically?",
    "answer": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that mediate intercellular communication by transferring proteins, nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNA), and lipids between cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, exosomes secreted by cancer cells can promote angiogenesis, immune suppression, metastasis, and drug resistance. For example, exosomes can transfer microRNAs that silence tumor suppressor genes in recipient cells or deliver proteins that activate signaling pathways promoting cell survival and proliferation. Exosomes can also modulate the immune response by delivering immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells. Therapeutic strategies targeting exosomes include inhibiting their biogenesis or release, blocking their uptake by recipient cells, or engineering them to deliver therapeutic payloads such as siRNAs or drugs. Exosome-based diagnostics are also being developed to detect tumor-derived molecules in liquid biopsies, providing a non-invasive approach for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. The complexity of exosome biology and their diverse roles in cancer highlight their potential as both therapeutic targets and delivery vehicles.",

    "question": "How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, contribute to cancer development and progression?",
    "answer": "Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. In cancer, aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters and global hypomethylation, can lead to gene silencing and genomic instability, respectively. Histone modifications, including acetylation and methylation, affect chromatin structure and accessibility, influencing gene transcription. For example, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. Aberrant activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and HDACs is frequently observed in cancer, contributing to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Epigenetic drugs, such as DNMT inhibitors (e.g., azacitidine) and HDAC inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat), can reverse these epigenetic changes, restoring gene expression and inducing cell death or differentiation. Combinations of epigenetic therapies with other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, are being explored to improve patient outcomes. The reversibility of epigenetic modifications makes them attractive targets for cancer therapy.",

    "question": "What are the key differences between CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in treating hematologic malignancies?",
    "answer": "CAR T-cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's own T cells (or donor T cells in allogeneic CAR-T) to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific tumor-associated antigen, leading to targeted killing of cancer cells. Allo-HSCT, on the other hand, replaces a patient's hematopoietic system with donor cells, relying on the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect to eliminate cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy offers high initial response rates and can be used in heavily pretreated patients, but carries risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Allo-HSCT provides a potentially curative option but is associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and higher mortality. CAR T-cell therapy is typically used for relapsed/refractory disease, while allo-HSCT is often considered in earlier lines of therapy, depending on disease risk factors and donor availability. The mechanisms of action, toxicities, and long-term outcomes differ significantly between these two modalities, influencing treatment selection based on individual patient characteristics and disease biology.",

    "question": "How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapies?",
    "answer": "The gut microbiome plays a significant role in modulating the host immune response and influencing the efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapies. Certain gut bacteria can enhance the response to immunotherapy by stimulating systemic immunity and promoting T-cell infiltration into tumors. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila has been associated with improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma. Conversely, some bacteria can metabolize chemotherapeutic drugs, reducing their efficacy or increasing their toxicity. Gut dysbiosis, or imbalance in the gut microbiome, can lead to inflammation and increased susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced side effects, such as mucositis and diarrhea. Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions, are being explored to improve cancer treatment outcomes and reduce treatment-related toxicities. Understanding the complex interactions between the gut microbiome, the immune system, and cancer therapies is crucial for developing personalized treatment approaches.",

    "question": "What is the role of liquid biopsies in cancer management, and what are their advantages and limitations compared to traditional tissue biopsies?",
    "answer": "Liquid biopsies, which analyze circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and exosomes in blood or other bodily fluids, offer a non-invasive approach for monitoring cancer progression, detecting minimal residual disease, and identifying actionable mutations. Unlike traditional tissue biopsies, liquid biopsies can be performed repeatedly over time, providing real-time information about tumor dynamics and treatment response. They can also capture tumor heterogeneity by sampling multiple sites simultaneously. However, liquid biopsies have limitations, including low sensitivity in early-stage disease, challenges in isolating and analyzing rare CTCs, and difficulties in distinguishing tumor-derived ctDNA from cell-free DNA released by normal cells. Despite these limitations, liquid biopsies are increasingly being used in clinical practice to guide treatment decisions, monitor response to therapy, and detect resistance mechanisms. They hold great promise for personalized cancer management and early detection of recurrence.",

    "question": "How do structural variants (SVs) in the human genome contribute to disease susceptibility, and what technologies are used to identify them?",
    "answer": "Structural variants (SVs), including deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations, represent a significant source of genetic variation in the human genome and contribute to disease susceptibility. SVs can disrupt gene function, alter gene dosage, or create novel fusion genes, leading to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and Mendelian disorders. Traditional methods for detecting SVs, such as karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), have limited resolution and throughput. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and exome sequencing, have enabled the identification of SVs at higher resolution, but require specialized algorithms and computational tools for analysis. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, can span large genomic regions and resolve complex SVs more accurately. Integration of multiple sequencing technologies and computational approaches is essential for comprehensive SV detection and characterization in disease studies.",

In diagnostics, AI algorithms can analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays, CT scans, MRIs) to detect subtle patterns indicative of disease, improving accuracy and reducing diagnostic errors. ML models can integrate clinical data, genomic information, and lifestyle factors to predict disease risk and treatment response, enabling personalized treatment strategies. AI-powered virtual assistants can provide patients with remote monitoring and support, improving adherence to treatment plans and reducing healthcare costs. However, challenges remain in ensuring data privacy, addressing algorithmic bias, and validating AI models in diverse patient populations.
